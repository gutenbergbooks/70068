  <h2 class='c005'>I<br> FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Philadelphia is called the City of Homes with good
reason. Come into her ample confines from any point
you please and you see row upon row of little two-story,
stone-stepped houses of red brick, perhaps with a grass-plot front
or rear, shade trees in a singular variety, and a certain distinctive
contentment and prosperity in the very air above the myriad
simmering chimneys.</p>

<p class='c011'>For all her malodorous misgovernment of time past, whose
survivals are being eradicated step by step, with a long stride
forward for each disheartening setback, it is a crowning glory
of Philadelphia that thousands upon thousands of these little
houses have held their own all these years, instead of the teeming,
noisome rookeries that are the bane of many another metropolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>A million people—more than half the population—live in
single dwellings.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are tenements, of recent origin: there is in prospect
a tenement problem. But the satisfaction of the developed
instinct of the home-builders and housekeepers of Philadelphia
does not lie in the direction of the sky-scraping multiple dwelling,
which replaces a front porch with a fire-escape, makes a box of
geraniums or a rubber-plant do duty for a garden, festoons the
vista between towering walls with “the short and simple flannels
of the poor,” and suspends the growing child like Mahomet’s
coffin half-way between a clouded heaven of grimy skylight or
gravelled roof and the cluttered inferno of the pavement far below.</p>

<p class='c011'>Philadelphia families, accustomed to think of health and
comfort largely in terms of the upgrowing generation, prefer
privacy to promiscuity, and love their own vine and fig-tree,
rising from the ground level, with the tenacious affection that
attaches to a patriarchal inheritance. Where the individual
home is an impossible luxury, the multiple dwelling that is reared
must recognize the right of the family to every procurable blessing
and convenience of the single house.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The pages that follow describe the effort of a thoughtful group
of Philadelphians to provide cleanly homes and a healthy environment
for families in modest circumstances or in self-respecting
poverty. This effort—now twenty-one years old—has outgrown
the stage of experiment, but it never will deny new light
nor wholly abandon, however it may adapt, the ideals that are
Octavia Hill’s own spiritual legacy. Who this great and good
woman was and what she did for humanity are explained in the
opening chapter. The life-story of the work in Philadelphia that
perpetuates her name and her influence is next set forth. The
reader is then taken into the places where the Association has
labored to clean out and to build up in order that sun and air
and running water may perform their medicinal offices for body
and soul together; that germs and vermin may be routed with
the dirt that breeds them; that babies may have a chance to
grow into decent and useful citizens; that a sense of neighborliness
and interdependence may be fostered even among those
whose nationality, religion and language are diverse.</p>

<p class='c011'>From first to last this is an enterprise of business, and not of
charitable dole. We therefore are given to see the “friendly
rent-collector” going from door to door, gently but firmly insisting
upon payment when the stipulated sum falls due. We find her
lending an ear as “guide, philosopher and friend” to a wide
category of troubles great and small—none too large and none
too minute for her fearless and sympathetic consideration. She
does not give alms. She makes no vague and lavish promises
of benefits to fall like manna from the skies. She bestows aid
upon those who help themselves. She is a walking delegate, not
of insurrection and discontent but of courage and self-respect,
and the inculcation of thrift and cleanliness and personal responsibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are taken on his rounds with the Superintendent, whose
function is the oversight of the work of tearing down and building
up, of constructing and of reconstructing, in all its phases. We
see that a great deal of the effort of the bricklayer and the carpenter,
the plasterer and the plumber, under this shrewd
and constant oversight goes to the rebuilding of old houses, and
the adaptation of decadent dwellings to the modern advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of those who have suffered under conscienceless and grinding
owners, mindful of profit only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The work of the Association in the capacity of agent for
properties it does not hold is set forth, and the question of the
worth-whileness of the undertaking is finally considered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The writer has been aided without stint at every turn by those
whose names appear in the text, and whose self-effacement precludes
a proper acknowledgment of their help. He will remember
always the mothers and fathers and children met in the course
of his social exploration from house to house. He has merely
written this little book: they have been the making of it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Many a Browning Society has little to do with Browning,
and many a reading circle takes Shakespeare’s
name in vain: but in the case of the Octavia Hill Association
there is so close a correspondence between the work and
the practical idealism of the woman whose name it bears that
a study of her career of service to humanity in England and
thus throughout the world sheds light upon the organized and
incorporated effort in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Octavia Hill was the eighth daughter among eleven children
of James Hill of Peterborough. Her mother was the third wife
of Mr. Hill, who inherited his father’s successful business as corn-merchant
and upon the proceeds came to grief as a banker.
Altruist, reformer and book-lover, the financial panics of 1825
and 1840 were too much for him. Upon his mental and physical
collapse, Octavia’s mother took her daughters to a cottage at
Finchley, provided by her father, Dr. Southwood Smith, the
noted sanitarian.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Octavia was thirteen, her mother removed to London
to become manager of a Guild for the employment of women.
One of the workers at the Guild lent Octavia books and pamphlets
on the life of the poor, which so greatly depressed her that “she
began to think that all laughter or amusement was wicked.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>But she was cured of that delusion when she was given an
active part in the work of the Guild, and found how necessary
fun and frolic are to relieve the monotony of working lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little Octavia was put in charge of a work-room in which
girls of about her own age made toys. Since she was poor herself,
she realized to the full their lives of drudgery and hardship, and
she did all she could to make them happy. Some years later
she wrote of this period: “We were so very, very poor, and home
was like a little raft in a dark storm, where the wonder every
day was whether we could live through it; and now the sea looks
calm, even if there are waves; and we have leisure to look at the
little boat in which we sail. I wonder if it will ever be painted
with high colors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was at about this time that Octavia asked Ruskin to teach
her drawing; and his assent brought a new and a constraining
influence to bear on all her life. “I would give years,” she wrote
after the meeting, “if I could bring to Ruskin ‘the peace which
passeth all understanding.’” Ruskin told her she was “far more
accurate” than any of his college pupils. No wonder Ruskin,
the artist and ameliorist at once, found her an apt pupil, taking
fire from the gleam of his own restless inspiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>An address by Kingsley, delivered before an association of
women created to promote sanitary reform, helped Octavia, at
twenty, to visualize her objective. Kingsley adverted to the fact
that small houses were passing more and more into the possession
of individuals, and declared that legislation must recognize the
fact. “He was not going into the question here; it would have
to be attended to, but it seemed a great way off. Therefore he
hoped women would go, not only to the occupiers, but to the
possessors of the house, and influence people of ‘our own class.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this, her summary of the speaker’s somewhat vague and
not over-optimistic conclusions with regard to the possibility
of legislative action, Octavia seems to be feeling a challenge to
the deepest in her nature, and to a maturing if not a finally fixed
conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of 1860, just after Octavia’s twenty-second birthday,
came an event of moment—one of the great crises in her
life, her biographer styles it—in the removal to 14 Nottingham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Place. She arranged to have poor women come to the house
weekly to sew. One night a woman fainted, and Miss Hill’s
sympathetic inquiry elicited the fact that she had not slept the
previous night; she had been washing clothes and rocking the
baby’s cradle at the same time with her foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hill called at the poor woman’s home next day, and found
that it was a damp, unsanitary kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>She then tried to find other and better quarters, but there
was no place where they would take the children. She was given
in her quest to realize that at her very door there were squalid,
teeming homes like those from which the little toy-workers came;
and she brooded upon the sorrowful fact.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the cloud she came to Ruskin to bring him some of
her drawings. She found him in a pessimistic frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I paint, take my mother for a drive, dine with friends, or
answer these correspondents,” he said, as he pulled out some
letters from his pocket, “but one longs to be doing something
more satisfying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most of us feel like that at times,” ventured the devoted
pupil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what would you like to be doing?” was Ruskin’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something to provide better homes for the poor,” was the
girl’s answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ruskin wheeled sharply about in his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you a business plan?” was his challenge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then and there Octavia Hill’s life-work was born.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ruskin told her he had no time to attend to the details of
management as landlord, but he said he would buy a tenement
house if she would run it for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wanted five per cent. on his investment. He didn’t care
for the money, he said, but he thought others would be far more
likely to follow the example set if the enterprise were put on a
business basis from the start.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who will ever hear of what I do?” exclaimed Octavia.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she entered whole-heartedly into the fulfilment of the
suggestion, and said she would do her best to make the scheme pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then began the long, long search for a house, with a garden,
where she might create modest and wholesome apartments for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the poor. Landlords and agents as soon as they learned what
she was after interposed all manner of objections.</p>

<p class='c011'>In answer to one of these heartless rebuffs Octavia exclaimed:
“Where, then, <i>are</i> the poor to live?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” said the agent. “I only know they’ve got
to keep away from the St. John’s Wood Estate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the spring of 1865, she was able to announce triumphantly
that Ruskin had bought for her, for a term of fifty-six years,
three houses in a court close by. The tenants came with the
houses. She had schemes for the recreation of the children, and
she meant to secure a playground for them. “The plan promises
to pay; but of this I say very little; so very much depends on
management, and the possibility of avoiding bad debts.” To
Mrs. Shaen, wife of the lawyer who negotiated the sale, she wrote
presently: “The money part is very regular and simple, just so
much paid into Ruskin’s bank each quarter; but to me the work
is of engrossing interest. We have three houses, each with six
rooms; and we have managed gradually to get the people to
take two rooms, in many cases.” The garden had come with
Ruskin’s enthusiastic purchase of six more houses; and the cup
of the busy landlady’s satisfaction is filled to overflowing. “The
children seem to have so few joys, and they spring to meet any
suggestion of employment with such eagerness, instead of fighting
and sitting in the gutter, with dirty faces and listless, vacant
expression. I found an eager little crowd threading beads last
time I was in the playground. We hope to get some tiny gardens
there; and Ruskin has promised some seats. I hope to teach
them to draw a little; singing we have already introduced. On
the whole, I am so thankful, so glad, so hopeful in it all; and,
when I remember the old days when I seemed so powerless, I
am almost awed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here we see in embryo several present day social movements
of wide outreach, all at once:—the suggestion and direction of
children’s games; the cultivation of home and school gardens;
community singing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The new owner found the houses occupied—to quote her own
words—“by a desperate and forlorn set of people; wild, dirty,
violent, ignorant as ever I have seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“I worked on quite alone about it,” she tells us, “preferring
power and responsibility and work, to committees, and their
slow, dull movements.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But as soon as she let her friends know what she was doing,
they rallied in force to her assistance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently in the crowding multiplicity of detail her life became,
she tells us, “a fight for mere existence. References, notices,
rents, repairs, the dry necessary matters of business, take up
almost all time and thought; only”—and here comes the saving
clause—“as, after all, we are human beings, and not machines,
people round, and all we see and hear, leave a kind of mark on
us; an impression of awe, or pity and wonder, or sometimes love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here I am,” she writes in another letter of about the same
date, “head and ears deep in notices about dustmen, requests
for lawyers to send accounts, etc., etc.... I’ve just come
in from a round of visits to the nine houses; and somehow it’s
been a day of small worries about all sorts of repairs, and things
of that kind. It is only when the detail is really managed on as
great principles as the whole plan, that a work becomes really
good.” That last sentence holds the vital germ of Octavia Hill’s
own philosophy, living on in the work of the Association that
bears her name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of giving alms she gave herself. The student of her
work cannot fail to note how sedulously she refrained from handing
out money when that would have been the easiest thing to do.
In 1869 she had read a paper before the Social Science Association
on “The Importance of Aiding the Poor Without Alms-giving,”
and on this point she was obdurate. Even her strong champion
Ruskin was unwilling to go all the way with her in this policy,
and he shrank from contact with the ugliness that she met to
give it battle day after day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Artisans’ Dwelling Act in 1875 was a great parliamentary
victory for housing reform, and it was in large part Miss Hill’s
victory. Moreover, the Committee which investigated the
operation of the Act five years later owed much to Miss Hill’s
continued cooperation. This is the period of the specialized
effort of Miss Hill in behalf of Open Spaces. When the bill for
the artisans’ houses came up for its second reading in the House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Miss Hill was present, tremulously eager of course to behold its
reception and to know its fate. Suddenly, to her intense gratification,
a speaker brought forward an article she had written
for Macmillan’s Magazine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Instead of quoting dry facts and figures, he read aloud from
it the description of the wonderful delight it gave me to see the
courts laid open to the light and air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be remarked that no compilation of facts and figures
will ever convey a fair idea of the work of Miss Hill or the work
of the Octavia Hill Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>By 1877 Miss Hill’s work had grown till it concerned the welfare
of 3,500 tenants and the prudent husbandry of some $200,000
in trust funds. Lord Pembroke gave Miss Hill $30,000 to buy
houses, and paid a worker. Then she had to go away to rest,
and the years from 1878 to 1880 were spent chiefly in travel,
that took her to the Levant, though she kept in contact with
her ruling passion by intimate and affectionate correspondence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon her final return she was asked by the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners to undertake the management of much of their
property in Southwark. She accepted the charge. She began
the successful movement which lasted six years, from 1883 to
1889, to add Parliament Hill, and a tract adjoining, to Hampstead
Heath. This achievement must stand among her greatest
benefactions to humanity. It meant obtaining $1,500,000 by
private gift and municipal appropriation, and not merely saving
a great playground of the poor but doubling its area.</p>

<p class='c011'>She took charge of forty-eight houses in Deptford, in South
London, in 1884, and in 1885 accepted the responsibility for
seventy-eight more in the same region. In 1887 the number of
tenants had increased to 5,000. The Red Cross Cottages and
Garden in Southwark opened in June of this year are salient
examples of Miss Hill’s magic wand in ousting ugliness and
creating graciousness and beauty in its place. The hall, designed
for music and other neighborhood entertainment, has unusual
decorations by Walter Crane, representing just such actions of
peaceful heroism as any one of us, at any time, might be called
on to perform. The first picture was that of Alice Ayres, a servant
girl, who saved children from a fire in Southwark. Since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>heroine came from their own walk in life, and was known to
some of them, the tenants felt a living link of interest with the
painting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The burden of the Deptford Cottages was progressively taken
over by an enlarging number of assistants. Though many of
these were volunteers, since Miss Hill never surrendered her
belief in the system that brought women of refinement and leisure
into contact with those whose lot was toiling poverty, the desirability
of the service of professional supervisors was recognized,
and over each group of houses as served by the volunteer assistants
there was set a paid worker to direct the collection of the rents
and all the diversified effort for the welfare of the tenants.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a time these head women and their charges, while they
never ceased to look to Miss Hill for guidance and inspiration,
became more and more independent of her actual oversight,
and as they gained confidence and knowledge the work became
progressively decentralized.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hill was one of the pillars of the Kyrle Society, created
by her sister Miranda, which sought to bring beauty into the
lives of the poor, to secure open spaces, and to convert city burial
grounds in congested areas to the uses of the living. She was a
prime mover in the Charity Organization Society, earnestly
striving to keep before that body the paramount importance of
personality in charity, and the influence of enthusiastic and warmhearted
individual effort for individuals. She was a member
of the Women’s University Settlement in Blackfriars’ Road.
She was one of the founders of the National Trust for Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. She was a member of the
Royal Commission on the Poor Laws. She saved land along
the banks of the River Wandle from desecration, for the perennial
joy of the poor. After her “Homes of the London Poor” had
been translated into German by Princess Alice, the Octavia Hill
Verein was formed in Berlin. Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee
took counsel with her, and installed her methods in groups of
houses municipally controlled. The housing system in Amsterdam
was influenced by her work, and traces of it are to be found
in Sweden. Students of her methods came from near and far
to be instructed. The effort of such women as Ellen Collins and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Josephine Shaw Lowell in New York gladly acknowledged the
impress of Miss Hill’s ideals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aside from her personal correspondence, the record of beneficent
activity is to be found in her two volumes, “Homes of the
London Poor,” and “Our Common Land,” and in the series of
annual “Letters to My Fellow-workers,” privately circulated,
which began in 1873 and continued until December, 1911.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The main tone of action,” she affirms, in “Homes of the
London Poor,” “must be severe. There is much of rebuke and
repression needed, although a deep and silent under-current of
sympathy and pity may flow beneath. If the rent is not ready,
notice to quit must be served.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An all-important factor is the “friendly rent-collector” who,
while firm in her insistence upon prompt payment of the rent,
forms a living link of sympathy and perception between the
landlord or landlady and the tenant, and among the tenants
themselves. The thorough training of this collector is essential,
and for this training Miss Hill left minute prescriptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>In her Letter for 1879, Miss Hill says,—and she repeats the
passage in the Letter for 1896,—“All the smoky chimneys,
broken water-pipes, tiresome neighbors, drunken husbands,
death, disease, poverty, sin, call not only for your sympathy but
for your action.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You cannot deal with the people and their houses separately.
The principle on which the whole work rests, is that the inhabitants
and their surroundings must be improved together,” she
writes in “Homes of the London Poor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hill wanted trees planted and vines trained against the
houses, and gardens wherever possible. She cites with approval
the example of children who thrust flowers in a crevice in the
wall, to make it, as they said, “like it was the day we had the
May-pole.” “A bunch of flowers brought on purpose,” is mentioned
among the gifts that are not destructive of independence,
and that assist what she beautifully calls the “return to the old
fellowship between rich and poor.” “She takes them flowers”
is part of her commendation of one of her friends who went tactfully
among her people. In a touching Letter she speaks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>widows who came home from a country outing with wild flowers
to surprise the children when they woke in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>She pleads for organized, directed play, in behalf of children
“wholly ignorant of games,” who “have hardly self-control
enough to play at any which have an object or require effort.”
She holds that there must be play supervisors for a playground
she has started, and “these I hope to find more and more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In one of the Letters she asks for public music definitely
planned and schooled. “I hope that we may have a more organized
body of singers, led by a conductor whom they know,
and ready to sing in out-of-the-way places.” In another Letter
she refers to the value of uplifting music on Sundays, and of a
violin class.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of a cadet corps for the boys she heartily approved. “There
is no organization which I have found influence so powerfully
for good the boys in such a neighborhood.” The Boy Scouts of
today would have been to her a cause for devout thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Letter for 1907 she gives it as her belief that the work
of agency in the management of properties for others is destined
to expand significantly. This, of course, has become a most
important part of the work of the Octavia Hill Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>With each of the Letters there appears a financial balancesheet
reduced to simplest terms of receipts and expenditure.
Behind these items, she declares, are “trembling hopes and fears
about each individual.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The book “Our Common Land” sets forth chiefly Miss Hill’s
views on the vital issue of open spaces,—“open air sitting-rooms”
she called them. She yearns to bring the people at large into
the air and the light of day. The two great wants in the life of
the poor are the want of space and the want of beauty. She has
much to say of the mortmain of the city graveyard that keeps
the living out of an available breathing space.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last decade of Miss Hill’s life saw the fruition of the years
of anxiety and uncertainty, but there was no cessation of labor.
“Up to within three days of her death,” writes her biographer,
“she continued to see her friends and fellow-workers, using to
the utmost her failing strength, and endeavoring to arrange for
the efficient carrying on of the many works in which she took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>such a keen interest.” When they told her that the end must be,
she said, thinking only of her work, “I might have given it a few
more touches, but I think it is nearly all planned now, very well.”
On the night of August 13, 1912, in the words of her beloved
Chaucer, her “spirit changed house.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>III<br> THE ASSOCIATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Any enterprise of social amelioration has its doubting
Thomases and its Job’s comforters to contend with at
the beginning, and the Octavia Hill Association has not
been exempt from the need of explaining why it should exist,
and why good citizens should uphold its ministration.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are terrible homes for the underworld of Vienna called
“Massenhotels.” It is a common experience to find twenty or
thirty people of both sexes living in one room, each occupant
paying ten cents a week for a quarter of a bed. Sometimes the
room is windowless. Disease is rife, and the stench of the filthy
bodies and the filthy clothing that clutters the rotting walls is
intolerable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank God we have nothing like that here in Philadelphia!”
exclaimed a good woman, throwing up her hands at this description.
“It’s too bad that they can’t have the Octavia Hill Association
in cities that need it more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But these festering, sweltering Poles, Jews, Slovaks and Croats
of darkest Vienna are the submerged ones of a capital whose
municipal motto is “On with the Dance;” whose name is the
synonym of gayety and folly. These miserable folk, who call
a little thin potato soup and a thimbleful of bad brandy a square
meal, may have reached a lower stratum of existence than most
Americans have seen. Does that excuse a complacency that takes
it for granted that whatever is out of sight under the lid in Philadelphia,
San Francisco, Chicago or New Orleans is all right?</p>

<p class='c011'>Philadelphia has a Civic Club that has been a blessing to
the city in its work for the reign of law, through the virtuous
energizing of good women. It has battled for everything that
makes for better conditions of housing and of living in a city.
The list of good works it has brought out of dreamland into the
light of common day is as diversified as the life of the great city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>which the persistent effort of this Club has sweetened and ennobled.
It was but natural that the Octavia Hill Association
should have its genesis among friends in council who met in the
hospitable quarters of the Club in the winter and spring of 1895–96
to study the large and many-angled problem of fair play for
the metropolitan poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had been previous efforts, such as that of the Benevolent
Building Association of 1865, to provide bright and cleanly
dwellings for families of limited earning capacity. In 1885 a
lending library for children, in the heart of a negro district at
Seventh and St. Mary Streets, brought home to its benevolent
promoters the need of a new and improved order of living in the
hovels where the books were circulated. It was plain that a
transformation was not to be wrought merely by the magic of
good books. People must take hold of people; life must come
into stimulating contact with life; the socially uplifted must
discover that the economically downtrodden were their neighbors.
Mr. Theodore Starr had already made an inspiring beginning
near at hand. He had bought and razed horrid eyesores of dwellings
and had put up in their place rows of well-built houses that
appealed to a better class of tenants. The result of his enterprise
was felt throughout the region. With the name of Theodore
Starr, honoris causa, must be associated those of Edith Wright
Gifford and Hannah Fox. The latter not merely bought and
improved dwellings in this St. Mary Street district but personally
undertook their management upon the successful plan of Octavia
Hill which she so intimately understood. When she had studied
the local problem in its practical aspects for several years, she
met the beloved, untiring altruist, Mrs. William F. Jenks and
others in the conferences mentioned, and in these sessions a
report was discussed and prepared. They then went before the
Civic Club with the report, and asked for its sanction and its
furtherance. The Civic Club responded instantly and whole-heartedly,
and the Octavia Hill Association was formed as an
independent organization, to have for its specialized concern the
provision of homes of the right sort, for families of modest means.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Calling for a Change.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Cooperation became corporation, under the laws of Pennsylvania,
June 25, 1896. Nathaniel B. Crenshaw was the first
President; Frank H. Taylor was chosen Treasurer, and Mrs.
Thomas S. Kirkbride became Secretary. The original Board of
Directors comprised Miss Fox, Mr. Crenshaw, Mrs. Jenks, Mrs.
Kirkbride, and Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Kirkbride—a tower of strength and of consecrated purpose
in this work as in all movements for the greater good of the
greater number in Philadelphia—expressed so perfectly the purpose
of the new organization in her first report as secretary,
(January 1, 1897) that we cannot do better than to use her statement
here:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The object of the Civic Club,” she wrote, “is ‘to promote
by education and active cooperation a higher public spirit and a
better social order.’ The Octavia Hill Association, although an
independent organization, works for the same higher spirit and
better order, on its own definite and restricted, but most important,
lines. It sees in insanitary, dilapidated, and overcrowded
dwellings, influences which lower the moral and the physical
health of Philadelphia. Against these evil influences it aims to
enlist the cooperation of citizens who, well housed themselves,
desire the same advantage for less fortunate Philadelphians.
This cooperation is solicited on strict business conditions, and
it is believed that a safe investment of capital and a fair rate of
interest are offered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This first report announced that the modus operandi of the
Association would be “to refit old properties and small houses,
first of all putting in modern plumbing and so far as possible
removing all unhealthful surroundings.” The report then described
that ideal of the community of interest between landlord and
tenant, realized through the friendly rent-collector as the intermediary,
which is the central and the most inspiring feature of
the personal phase of the undertaking. It was also announced
that the Association stood ready to assume the kindly oversight
of private property, to buy houses offered at a figure which would
not be prohibitive of moderately profitable purchase and renovation,
and to issue stock to subscribers. “The Association’s
strongest claim upon the confidence of the community,” it was
declared, “lies in the fact that its philanthropic interests are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>founded on true business principles; its business interests upon
the principles of a sound philanthropy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon this platform devised twenty-one years ago, the Association
has stood, and continues to stand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stock company, empowered by its charter to hold, sell
and lease real estate, fixed the par value of the stock at the low
figure of $25, so that a great many persons might have a share
and an active sustaining interest therewith. The distribution
of profits would thus be effected easily, in the form of dividends
on the capital stock. These dividends for the first two years
were 4½ per cent. per annum; the annual dividend since that
time has been 4 per cent. At the end of 1916 the outstanding
capital stock was $221,475, with an authorized capital of $300,000.
There was a surplus of about $16,000, and the usual dividend of
4 per cent. was declared, payable February 1, 1917.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the time of its incorporation as a stock company, the
Association had a capital of $20,000. Many of the original group
of stockholders were members of the Civic Club, who not merely
subscribed but induced their friends to subscribe, thus giving an
effectual assistance in the expansion of the Association that is
beyond evaluation. At a special meeting in November, 1898,
it was voted to increase the capital stock to $50,000. At the
same meeting the number of directors was enlarged from five to
seven, and Miss Helen L. Parrish and R. Francis Wood were
added to the Board. In 1911, Miss Parrish became the secretary.
She had studied the work of Miss Hill in London at first hand
for some months, so that her experience has created a personal
link across the seas between the work of the altruist in London
and that of the Association here.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again and again, since the original purchases were made,
individual members of the Board of Directors have assumed the
management of properties, and have found a keen personal
satisfaction in collecting the rents themselves and thus obtaining
a first hand insight into the work that could be obtained in no
other way. They have accordingly brought to the council-table
a practical and detailed knowledge such as few philanthropic
administrators have gained from within. Each of the directors
is in active service on one of the Committees, which are those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>finance, new property, office-administration and rent-collecting,
construction, inspection. As the work grew out of the day of
small things, the increasing burden of executive supervision
demanded the whole time of a personal representative of the
Board, and in 1908 a superintendent was employed. Frederick
C. Feld, a man of tact, enthusiasm and technical knowledge, now
fills this all-important office. Miss Garrison, the chief rent-collector,
has two regular and several volunteer assistants, and
brings to her work a rare combination of sympathetic interest
and the requisite firmness with the saving sense of humor wherein
philanthropists and reformers are so often—rightly or wrongly—declared
deficient.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association gladly accepts intelligent volunteer assistance,
but it believes also in the engagement of salaried employees who
follow the assured routine of professional occupation. There
are a bookkeeper, a stenographer, who has charge of the office,
and a varying number of mechanics in the jurisdiction of the
superintendent. When the Association began its work, the collectors
depended for their stipend upon a commission of 5 per cent.
from the rents collected. The clerical work was distributed
among the directors and the treasurer’s office. The first salaried
employee was engaged in 1901; the employment of the bookkeeper
dates from 1907. It will be seen that the business affairs
of the Association rest upon a foundation not dependent on the
continued proffer of unremunerated aid. This is the basis which
seems best, if the system is to be universally applied and standardized.
The problems of housing and sanitation are day-in
and day-out problems that require a constant vigilance and not
a divided interest or a sporadic enthusiasm that can detach itself
at pleasure from the object of its concern. The work of volunteers
is by no means undervalued in its unselfish service to this Association.
They have done, and are doing, admirable work. It
is a great relief to these volunteers themselves to feel that if they
must miss certain times and seasons, or withdraw altogether,
the bottom will not fall out of the beneficent enterprise with
which they have been identified.</p>

<p class='c011'>Furthermore, if the Association is understood to be an honest
and legitimate competitor in the open market with other real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>estate operators whose business is plain business, with no tincture
of philanthropy, it does not seem expedient to rely upon gratuitous
service in work for which the ordinary operator must carry
a pay-roll. Such a procedure, if the influence of an object-lesson
is sought, does not convince the dealer who is without philanthropic
assistance that he can live up to the standards of decency,
comfort, and cheapness his benevolent rival sets and still make
a satisfactory profit.</p>

<p class='c011'>It does not fall within the scope of this discussion to follow
from street to street or from one congested area to another each
of the separate acquisitions in the long list of purchases and leases
which the Association in the twenty-one years of its history has
made, or to recapitulate all the managerial responsibilities which,
to the gratification of the owners, it has from time to time assumed.
But to the acquisition and development of certain
typical properties we may profitably devote our attention, as
symptomatic of what has taken place with the entire number.
We must bear in mind, moreover, the wise principles of selection
that have guided the Association in deciding where to employ
its little army of busy hands in tearing down and building up,
in redeeming foulness to fairness, in letting air and light enter
where these had long been strangers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association has stipulated that the properties it took
over should be in need of reconstruction and improvement; that
the price should be sufficiently low to allow of the necessary
repairs and still leave a fair return on the sum invested; that
the group dealt with should be large enough to present a conspicuous
object-lesson to the community. Many a neighborhood
must be—and is—a little ashamed to look itself in the face, after
regarding the spick-and-span aspect of the Association improvement
adjoining its unseemliness.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the properties acquired by the Association in the older
parts of the city, these three types, speaking generally, are to be
distinguished—the house that was built for one family and is
now occupied by several families; the small, one family house on
the narrow street or alley, having a yard of its own; the three-room
rear dwelling, set in rows of from two to perhaps ten houses
behind a house fronting upon a recognized thoroughfare. With
the latter type there may be two facing rows, at the rear of two
or three front lots. Or there may be a courtyard built round
three sides. In the control of the Association as agent are several
model tenements. It has erected a few small new houses, and
will build more of these in future, to an indeterminate extent.
It has built one large group of model houses for one or two families.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>If the people living in an old house acquired by the Association
are law-abiding and respectable they are not disturbed. Sometimes
it is necessary to oust occupants whose room proves better
than their company.</p>

<p class='c011'>In July, 1896, title was taken to the first of its properties by
the Association—five houses near Seventh and South Streets.
Four were small houses, one was a several-family dwelling. These
properties, after being set in order, were profitably managed, and
it would have been possible to pay a dividend, but it was decided
that it was better business for the first year to establish a surplus
with the proceeds.</p>

<p class='c011'>In May, 1897, eight small houses on Fairhill Street and one
on Lombard were added to the Association’s property. The
Fairhill Street houses were in a colored neighborhood. In February,
1899, seventeen houses on League Street came into the possession
of the Association. These houses needed and promptly
received new plaster, new woodwork and paint. The Association
had League Street put on the city plan, and obtained the introduction
of an ordinance to secure proper drainage. As a result
of its purchase a kindergarten was started, with an average
attendance of thirty pupils, for the swarms of children in the
neighborhood. It was conducted by the Social Science Department
of the Civic Club, with which the name of Mrs. Edward
Longstreth, a devoted servant of the public weal, will ever be
associated. Fairhill Street was repaved in 1899, no doubt to
keep pace with the new and progressive ownership of the eight
houses, and the water supply was increased by new pipe lines.
Ten houses of the Theodore Starr Estate—one a large dwelling
with eight two-room apartments—were put under Association
management in this year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Parrish has made a study, “The Improvement of a
Street,” published as a tract by the Association, which describes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the League Street development. League Street formerly bore
the somewhat significant name of Reckless Street. It is between
Front and Water Streets, and many of the men—largely Irish—are
boatmen, fishermen on the Delaware, or longshoremen on
the wharves. They have long slack seasons when they are exposed
to the loafer’s temptation of the gin-mill. In this neighborhood
the beautiful little Old Swedes’ Church, built in 1900 on the site
of an earlier block-house, is a landmark. In the green God’s
acre of the Episcopal sanctuary, with its quaint old parish
buildings and the sexton’s house, Alexander Wilson the famous
ornithologist lies buried.</p>

<p class='c011'>But ancient history or present picturesqueness meant little
to the brawling population outside the gate of the churchyard,
where switching-engines chugged along the docks and factory
chimneys clogged the air and iridescent surface drainage meandered
from yard to yard and made alleys pestilential. Foul privy-wells
undermined the yards and the foundations of the houses; the
rafters had in many places rotted away; the cellars were repositories
of rubbish.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was fine raw material here among the boys and men
for a hand of guidance and an inspiring personal presence—but
most of it was very raw indeed. The drink wrought mischief
among the womenfolk too; the children ran at large; the gangs
of hoodlum boys played hide-and-seek with the policemen to
steal lead pipe, to shatter windows, to break into the vacant
houses and despoil them. Six of the houses taken by the Association
were unoccupied. Each house was in a deplorable condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>The expenditure on these houses by the Association averaged
$186.</p>

<p class='c011'>The brickwork had to be painted; plumbing, painting, carpentering
and plastering were necessary. At first the tenants
were often unruly and irresponsible; fights were of frequent
occurrence. Though the rents were low—$6.50 to $10.00 a month—the
tenants often fell behind in payment, and there were many
unprofitable “unlets.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But with unwearied patience the Association strove to create
among the people in its houses a sense of thrift, of honor, of self-respect,
even of community spirit. It did not permit itself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>be discouraged by backsliding or ungratefulness. It fought on
for the sake of the regeneration not merely of seventeen houses
but of a community, and in 1905 it was able to offer the remarkable
result of $1432.00 paid in rents out of $1445.50 due, with a return
of 7½ per cent. on the investment, after paying to the Association
a commission of the same percentage on the rents collected.
A constant demand was created for the houses. The average
period of occupancy of the present tenants is seven years and
five months. The average net revenue has been nearly 6 per
cent. The result is as forceful evidence as could be presented of
the influence of the regular visits of the friendly rent-collectors.
The Southwark Settlement—a fine and flourishing organization
doing a splendid work near by—grew out of a play room and a
Mother’s Club of the Octavia Hill Association. In 1916 the
Association bought, under-drained and repaired the five remaining
houses of the street.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the Association did not confine its work within four walls.
It took a bare, depressing, ash-heap area 20 by 80 feet, added
to it the site of a house pulled down, and filled the vacancy—now
known as the Hector McIntosh Playground—with swings,
games and a sandpile. An ice-water fountain was placed on the
sidewalk. The women said that pitchers which once went out
for beer came back after that filled with ice-water instead.</p>

<p class='c011'>One example of this kind is worth no end of homily. It is an
epitome of the successful effort of the Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>From year to year the list of properties owned, or managed
by agency, has lengthened. The Casa Ravello, owned by Dr.
George Woodward and operated by the Association, was opened
in 1903 for the special benefit of Italians. It stands at the corner
of Seventh and Catharine Streets, and right on the corner, in a
store-space that could be rented for $40 a month, is a most valuable
outpost of the Starr Centre Association which shows poor
mothers what to do for their babies. In June, 1917, 219 different
babies under two years of age were brought here for consultation.
Nearly all were Italians. There were a few Jews and one colored
child. “History cards” are kept, and the fluctuation of weight
is traced by a graphic curve. There are home visits by nurses,
and two doctors keep office-hours.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The Casa Ravello has four stories of brick, the windows made
attractive by their gay boxes of geraniums, and air and light are
at every window through the liberal space the courtyard leaves.
The iron stairways come up through fire-towers, and there are
netted verandahs safe and roomy for the youngsters of the family
and the mothers resting or at work. On the roof in July and August
is a playground, and a summer school for the children. Of these
there are 79 in the building, and in midsummer, 1917, there was
an average attendance of 45 in the school. They wear little red
tags with their names, that the stranger may distinguish tiny
black-eyed Domenico from the toddling frolicsome Bettina.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mothers use the roof too—for gossiping, embroidery,
for hanging clothes, for the baby’s nap in a preferred location
of the hammock. There is a swing for larger children, and—safely
shut away between-whiles in a cement-floored bin—there
is a piano for the dance-lovers of Italy, great and small. All
this for thirty-four families, at a rate which at its maximum is
$14 for one of the three four-roomed apartments that boast a
bath-tub.</p>

<p class='c011'>On September 22, 1903, Emily W. Dinwiddie, who had been
a City Inspector of the Tenement House Department of New
York, began an investigation in behalf of the Association and
under its direction,—an investigation that lasted nearly a year.
The cost was defrayed by special contributions. It resulted in
a report which is in all ways a model for the emulation of others
engaged in social research. The Bureau of Building Inspection
and the Board of Health granted her every facility and permitted
her freely to accompany their inspectors. Her report, entitled
“Housing Conditions in Philadelphia,” embraced the results
of her thorough personal examination of 600 houses. For every
dwelling-place investigated a card of minutely particularized
details was filled out, of which facsimiles are presented, together
with telling pictures, maps, and tables of simple and explicit
arrangement giving according to nationality the statistics of
every phase of the living conditions ascertained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hannah Fox was chairman of the directing and assisting
committee of the Association; the other members were Dr. Frances
C. Van Gasken, Helen L. Parrish, Robert P. Shick, Dr. George
Woodward, E. Spencer Miller. Lawrence Veiller of New York,
with his wide official experience of tenement problems, was of
much assistance.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Italian Tenement Known as Casa Ravello. Thirty Apartments of Two and Four Rooms Each. First Floor Arranged for Stores</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The three areas studied were distributed and representative.
One was the block between Eighth and Ninth Streets, Carpenter
and Christian. A second was the segment of North American
and of Newmarket Streets lying between Vine and Callowhill.
The third took in the block bounded by Sixteenth, Eighteenth,
Lombard and Rodman Streets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here are some of the things Miss Dinwiddie found:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“One tenement visited was a three story house, without fire-escapes,
containing a grocery store, a fish stand and a meat shop
on the first floor. Above in the seventeen living rooms of all
kinds—kitchens, bed-rooms and dining rooms—were eight families,
consisting of thirty-three persons. A goat was kept in the
room back of the grocery, and three dogs upstairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A row of houses faced on an alley whose width varied from
three feet two inches to three feet eleven and a half inches.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Five houses on one court, of which four were occupied, had
cellars flooded with sewage from a leaking soil pipe, the foul water
standing about a foot deep in all but one of the buildings....
Beds and bedding, said to have been cast aside because someone
had died upon them, and it was ‘bad luck’ to use them again,
were not infrequently found in cellars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a certain alley “one hydrant was the only fixture for eleven
families in ten houses.” A colored woman in one of the foul
courts said: “I’m sorry to have you see my house lookin’ dis way,
lady, but ’tain’ no use tryin’ to be clean; we ain’t got but one
hydrant for dese yere five houses, an’ we ain’ had no water for
a week, since de pump busted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Animals kept on the premises are a serious evil. In a tenement
visited, “two rooms on the top floor were given up to the
raising of fowls, and the floors and parts of the walls were covered
with filth; in another house the door from the inside cellar stairs
was pushed open during an inspection and a goat stalked in;
in yet another, chickens were kept in a fenced-up corner of a
third story room, used at the same time as a kitchen and a bedroom.
Under a shop in one dwelling-house, white mice and rats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs were kept for sale. At about the
time of the festival of Yom Kippur, many yards and shed rooms
in the Russian-Jewish neighborhoods were seen covered with
blood and refuse of slaughtered fowls. The worst case found
was that of a slaughter house and dwelling in one building. About
thirty sheep were kept in the second story, which was reached
by an inclined runway from the narrow side alley, giving entrance
from the street to the rear of the house. Down stairs a room was
used for slaughtering, and from 30 to 100 sheep were killed daily.
The butcher and his family lived in the house, having a kitchen
on the ground floor and attractively furnished rooms upstairs
at the front. There were also dwellings adjoining on every side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Travellers in Tibet have described the ridges of filth that
accumulate in the middle of village streets and freeze in winter.
Tibet is on the other side of the world, and those whose complacency
is not to be disturbed like to believe that we have nothing
so abhorrent here. But listen to Miss Dinwiddie. “The condition
of the sidewalk varies with the seasons. In winter the
alleys and parts of the sidewalk are often covered with frozen
refuse of various kinds and ice from surface drainage. The writer
has seen the occupants of an alley obliged, for several weeks,
to climb over a hard frozen mass about two feet high, blocking
up the entire outer end of the court. In summer, on the other
hand, garbage accumulates rapidly, and the odors from the decomposition
of such matter and from the pools of drainage water
are offensive. As a visitor from ‘uptown’ remarked while taking
an alley picture, ‘If one could photograph the smells, it might
be possible to give an idea of this place.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the heads of the 843 families, there was represented
every occupation from that of card-sharp to that of minister or
rabbi; in the social strata rag-pickers, scrub-women and organ-grinders
were at the bottom, while opticians, pharmacists and
machinists stood at the top. Of unskilled laborers the total
number showed 39 per cent., and there was an equal proportion
of skilled laborers. Commercial pursuits were represented by
16 per cent., and the remaining 6 per cent. followed special occupations.
The bankers, musicians, organ-grinders, street cleaners,
candy makers and boot-blacks were in all cases Italians; of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>37 fruit, candy and fish dealers and rag-pickers all but two were
Italians. The worst instance of the sweating evil was found in
an Italian tailor shop. Laundry work at home was confined to
the colored district. Rag-picking (among Italians only), dress
making, tailoring, cobbling, cigar making, fish cake making,
herb brewing, plain sewing, scissors sharpening and umbrella
mending were the other occupations carried on in living rooms.
Fruit, vegetables and candy sold by trucksters were often stored
in living rooms over night. The fire risk does not need to be
emphasized in the case of one house, occupied by two families,
in which a marionette show took place nightly on the ground
floor, where smoking was permitted. Fish stores, bakeries and
dance halls were adjuncts of other crowded dwelling-places.</p>

<p class='c011'>The families living in apartments paid on the average $5.63
a month for rent; those in one family dwellings paid $10.36—almost
twice as much.</p>

<p class='c011'>In her full and simple suggestions for remedial action, Miss
Dinwiddie urged virtually the program of the Octavia Hill Association.
There should be strictly enforced regulations concerning
congestion, water supply and toilet accommodations, air and light.
Cellars and basements must not be used for sleeping purposes,
nor should animals be kept and slaughtered on the premises.
Ignorance and indifference on the part of landlord and tenant
alike, the investigator held, is the great obstacle in the way of
reform. The personal worker who will see clearly and report
frankly and fearlessly is indispensable. Such workers, it is clear,
are provided by the superintendence and the friendly rent-collection
of the Octavia Hill Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fruit of Miss Dinwiddie’s long and conscientious labor
with the Committee’s cooperation was a comprehensive legislative
measure embodying the ten years’ experience of the Association
and dealing with the adaptation to the purposes of three or more
families of houses originally built for one. An earlier law, of
1895, made the building of tenement houses, as such, so costly
that few since that time have been built for families of small
incomes. Its present day application is almost wholly to the
erection of high-class apartment houses. The new measure
prepared and backed by the Association came before the legislature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of 1905, and the selfish interests that would have suffered
by its passage fought it tooth and nail. Undismayed, the Association
and its friends rallied and returned to the attack, and in
1907, to their great satisfaction, it became a law. In the meantime,
in 1906, two ordinances were put before the city Councils
by the Association through its Committee: one providing for
underdrainage where a sewer connection was feasible; the other
prescribing improved water facilities, for court and alley houses
in particular. These ordinances did not pass, but in the agitation
of the matters upon which they focussed the attention of the
City Fathers and to some extent of the public at large, a useful
educational result was reached, for models illustrating the conditions
the Association sought to remedy were put on view at
Horticultural Hall, meetings were held, and the councilmen
were taken to see how the other half lived and to be impressed
by the necessity for drastic changes.</p>

<p class='c011'>When in 1907 the act providing for the licensing and inspection
of tenement houses was passed, the Director of Public Health
and Charities asked the Association to help him frame the rules
to govern the work of the new division of tenement house inspection.
The aid of the Association was given without stint, and
upon the Committee’s recommendation Miss Caroline Manning
was appointed as the first inspector.</p>

<p class='c011'>It thus appears that the Association was prime mover in
bringing the municipal administration to take action for the
systematic examination and regulation of living conditions to
ensure the health and comfort of the occupants of houses in
hitherto neglected areas. Out of this instigation grew, as an
arc of an ever-widening circle, the specialized activity of the
Philadelphia Housing Commission, now known as the Housing
Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>Delegates from forty social and philanthropic agencies met
in the Mayor’s reception room September 9, 1909, and organized
the Commission. A particular function of the organization has
been to obtain and enforce enlightened and equitable laws, and,
with that end in view, to appraise the public of its effort and
secure a distributive popular support. The Housing Association
is performing a service of inestimable usefulness in its study of
the direct relation between an evil domestic environment and
the character and physical condition of those who are constantly
exposed to it. It receives and acts upon thousands of complaints
each year, and carries on extensive and intensive campaigns of
public education by literature, illustrated lectures, and exhibits.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Monroe Street. A Typical Court After Renovation. Three-Room Houses With Cellar and Separate Toilet. Running Water in Kitchens. Rent $8.00 Per Month.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Resuming our examination of typical properties in the care
of the Octavia Hill Association, we find one of the most inspiring
examples in the group of houses at Workman Place.</p>

<p class='c011'>This large and picturesque court is situated on Front street
between Pemberton and Fitzwater. In Colonial days several
of the houses belonged to the Mifflin family; later they became
part of the Workman estate, and finally Mr. and Mrs. E. W.
Clark acquired the group by instalments and turned it over to
the Association to manage.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are twenty-two houses in all, built of red brick. Five
of these face on Front Street, and these, with one on Pemberton
Street, have several occupants each. Behind the Front Street
dwellings, surrounding the ample open space of what was once
a large garden, are the remaining houses, in groups, conveying
a delightful impression of an island of peace and privacy in the
midst of the sweltering sea of humanity in this loud and crowded
foreign quarter. In the houses that face on Front Street there
are wainscotted halls, carved balustrades and mantelpieces with
elaborate designs of ships and grapes and fluting that bespeak
the past glories of the more deliberate day of minuet and sedanchair
and the soft light of candles. Even the ancient windowpulleys
were made of mahogany. One has only to read the
itemized list of the household goods owned in 1754 by George
Mifflin, Jr., as given in the Pennsylvania Historical Magazine, to
realize the difference between that day and the present, wherein
the Polish seamstress bends above her work in a room still haunted
by the ancestral presences of those who were as deft in turning
the heel of a stocking as in pouring tea. In the smaller houses
there will be found Irish tenants who survive the Polish invasion
of the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Pemberton Street there are two small vine-clad cottages
with “G. M. 1748” set out in black bricks against the red, betokening
George Mifflin’s ownership. These houses were doubtless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>occupied by his servants. They are not unlike the little
“Letitia Cottage” of Penn in Fairmount Park. The Association
set above windows and doorways slight projections that enhance
the aspect. Betwixt these cottages an iron gateway admits to
the large enclosure shaded by great trees, on which all the tiny
gardens of the houses surrounding abut. The base of each tree
is rimmed by a seat. There is abundant room for clothes-lines,
not infringing on the space for the children’s play. A pavilion
is at one side. On the Fitzwater Street exposure is a temporary
shelter to impound homeless animals till the S. P. C. A. wagon
comes to claim them.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the corner of Front and Fitzwater Streets, through the
generous initiative of a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clark, is Workman
Place House, a Settlement of such demonstrated value to
the region round about that it deserves more than passing mention.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is conducted by the Alpha Pi Fraternity of young women
alumnæ of the Agnes Irwin School. The Matron has taken
hundreds of mothers and children of the neighborhood during
the summer into the country, which is as novel and startling
to many of these people as America was to the sailors of Columbus.
The great fact of Fairmount Park itself is news to an incredible
number. University of Pennsylvania students have taken the
boys to summer camps. There has been supervised play in
summer, and in the winter months there is a carefully scheduled
and well-attended routine of classes and meetings for young and
old. All these people have a racial affiliation with the dance,
and even after the Mothers’ meetings in the Good Neighbors’
Club, dancing to the pianola is an exuberantly joyful exercise.
Christmas parties are red-letter events. The entire admirable
enterprise is sustained by bazaars, sales of old clothing, and gifts
in cash and in kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little vegetable and flower gardens at the rear or in the
forecourt of each of the Workman Place houses are sources of
not inconsiderable pride to the occupants. Anyone who saw the
central area before the Association took hold here must be amazed
at the transformation. The solid board fences that dissected
the space in all directions have been removed, the rubbish has
been carted away, wells and cesspools have been filled, and the
houses themselves—in a deplorably decrepit state—have been
renovated from top to bottom. The generous owners have not
sought an income from the property. Any returns have been
left in the hands of the Association, as the contracting agency,
for improvements or for the acquisition of other houses.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>A heartening example of the civic spirit generated in this
region by the presence of this great object-lesson of Workman
Place under the wise and watchful rule of the Association was
the flag-raising that occurred in midsummer, 1917, on the Fitzwater
Street side of the courtyard. Benjamin Barton, a resident
of the block, went from house to house inducing his neighbors
to scrub the steps and the cobbles till they shone with the lustrousness
of Spotless Town; then they all, at his suggestion, hung out
brave new flags, the eagles of Poland on their red and white
field prominent among them. Little Maria Barton, dressed as
the Goddess of Liberty, stood on the rear seat of the hard-working
Ford car belonging to the Association and released the Star-Spangled
Banner over the street, midway of the block. Mr.
Barton and others made speeches, and Fitzwater Street is still
talking of its great day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The playground at Workman Place, the use of the roof of
the Casa Ravello, the Hector McIntosh Playground at Front
and League Streets and playgrounds in Richmond and Germantown
in connection with properties about to be described, are
noteworthy examples of the manner in which the Association
is realizing Octavia Hill’s own insistent prescription of open
spaces. The Hector McIntosh Playground, to which we have
already referred, carries the name of the devoted second President
of the Association. It dates from 1902, when two friends of the
Association gave the land. Small as it is, even after the addition
of the site of 957 South Front Street, it has played a most useful
part in the lives of its patrons, young and old. Stockholders
have generously subscribed funds for its maintenance, and during
certain summers, in addition to the fun of the swings and games
and sandpile, and the work of the morning kindergarten, there
has been a series of seven or eight concerts of harp and violin
costing a dollar apiece on the average, and bringing out a delighted
throng to sing and to dance with the diminutive orchestra.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The Board of Recreation and the Playground Association, always
in sympathy with the objects of the Octavia Hill Association,
have liberally cooperated in this work, in such ways as planting
trees or providing a teacher.</p>

<p class='c011'>In January, 1911, the Association was requested by a physician
to turn a noisome group of houses, breeding-places of pestilence
and notorious hospital-feeders, on East Rittenhouse Street in
Germantown, into something that would not be a standing rebuke
to the community and the worst possible advertisement of the
thriving and progressive suburb. After a meeting at the house
of Mrs. Elizabeth Lean Head, residents of Germantown subscribed
for stock in the Association to the amount of $20,825, on
the understanding that the fund would be wholly devoted to
the purpose specified.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association thereupon acquired Nos. 523 and 531 to 551
inclusive, with a total frontage of 210 feet on East Rittenhouse
Street and a depth of 165 feet. The houses, near the Reading
Railroad, were occupied by Italians. There were 25 houses,
some of them run-down and filthy beyond the power of words
to portray. There was no underdrainage and two hydrants
provided all the water there was. Externally there were gaptoothed
sections of picket fence flat on the ground or sagging
drunkenly; smashed boxes and wrecked barrels were the least,
repulsive feature of the promiscuous clutter under the heavyladen
clothes-lines. One building, a mere outhouse, rented for
50 cents a month, and its wretched occupant had just been
removed in a dying condition from tuberculosis. Within were the
old, familiar features of ruin and decay and smells unholy. Three
houses were at once torn down. Others were renovated from
attic skylight to cellar floor, with the installation of modern
toilet facilities; and two new brick buildings—two stories high,
well lighted and well ventilated—were built with apartments
for 14 families. The two-room apartments rent for $6.50 per
month, and the four-room apartments for $11.00. In the entire
operation there are quarters for 35 families, and at the rear is
a large space available for a general playground and for tenants’
gardens. There was much stone-work, and the difficult site
necessitated a great deal of blasting in the solid rock.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>It has not been a triumphant progress from strength to strength
with these Germantown houses and their untrained and ignorant
Neapolitan and Sicilian occupants. Many of the men are unskilled
laborers for the city, content to earn a little and spend
the money in long seasons of idleness. Two volunteer rent-collectors,
speaking Italian, have been of great assistance, and
the summer playground, a visiting nurse, and garden allotments
have strengthened the hold of the Association upon the tenants.</p>

<p class='c011'>The transformation wrought by the summer of 1917 was
truly wonderful. In place of the abomination of desolation
described in the front yards of 1911, corn waved, and beanvines
flourished. Besides the gardens thriftily cultivated by each
householder where lettuce, celery and tomatoes grew in abundance,
there was a large community garden with a square plot for each
tenant, kept carefully weeded. From the windows giving upon
the street the flag of Italy flew, and on the steps the mothers of
little Italy sewed and gossiped and watched their bambini at
play. In the pavilion of the ample central yard were happy
families enjoying the shade, the children playing games, the
babies napping in their tiny hammocks swung from the eaves.
The whole offered as charming a picture of contentment in a
congenial environment as one would care to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>A group of new houses in the district known as Richmond,
an entire block of model dwellings for workingmen, represent
a distinct departure from the policy to which the Association
adhered for many years. But the enterprise, to which the Board
gave most of its time and thought in 1914, recommended itself
to the deliberate judgment of the members for two leading reasons—first,
that it was becoming constantly harder to find old downtown
houses for renovation which could be bought and altered
at a cost permissive of a dividend, and, second, that the demand
is waxing day by day for carefully designed and suitably equipped
low-priced dwellings, since the operative builder is unaffected
by philanthropy, and is building to sell or else to rent his houses
for at least $15 a month.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Property Committee of the Board obtained an option
on a tract in Richmond and was about to close the bargain when
the rude hand of war, that has paralyzed so many efforts for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>world’s good, descended on the market and made it prudent to
defer action until the spring of 1915. Then the more cheerful
financial prospect seemed to justify a resumption of the task.
A lot adjoining the one originally chosen, measuring 212 by 165
feet and fronting on Cambria Street, was obtained. The total
cost of the land and the dwellings that were put on it was $63,000.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Philadelphia Model Homes Company” was created
by the Board as a separate corporation to finance the undertaking,
to own and operate the dwellings, and to continue its
work in the future for any similar group it might be deemed wise
to create if the first venture justified itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The new corporation started with a nominal capital of $2,000.
This sum was presently raised to $20,000; and the capital stock
was entirely taken by the Octavia Hill Association, which named
the directors and entered into absolute control. The rest of the
cost of the operation—$43,500, or about two-thirds of the whole—was
obtained by the sale of first mortgages, each secured on a
particular lot and dwelling, and yielding 4.4 per cent. interest.
The Finance Committee devised the scheme because, in the
first place, it would limit the financial liability of the Association
to the $20,000 of its actual investment, and in the second place
the first mortgages at fixed interest on specific properties would
more readily secure takers than dividends on the stock of the
corporation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The block comprises sixteen one family and sixteen two-family
houses. Their appearance is very attractive. On the
west and the north is a new, wide city playground, giving a clean
sweep of sun and breeze. The houses surround on three sides
a large gravelled central area which creates a private playground—an
obvious advantage for the little ones who would be out of
place in the big, public playground designed for older and more
active children. At one end is a play pavilion, and the gardens
with open fences reach to the playground at the rear of the houses.
The central courtyard is entered by a driveway that permits
of the collection of ashes and garbage without littering the sidewalk
in front of the houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>An easy question is, why couldn’t these houses have front
verandahs on both stories? The equally easy answer is that
such verandahs add to the first cost and to the subsequent rental.
There are balconies at the rear.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Work was begun in the summer of 1915, and in December
the houses were completed and occupied. The work was done
under Mr. Feld’s daily supervision, and done well, without a
general contract. Thus a substantial saving was effected, and
the construction is abreast of the standard set in work carried
out on the usual plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>In each case a tenant was ready for the house when it was
ready for him. The rental is $8.50 per month for an apartment
of two rooms and bath, with a pantry having wash-tubs and a
range in one of the rooms. Each of the two families in an apartment
house has a partitioned share of the cellar. An apartment
of two rooms, kitchen and bath is to be had for $10.50. The
rental is $13.50 for the one family houses, which give the tenant
five rooms, with bath and furnace. There is at all times a waiting-list
for these eminently delightful and desirable little homes close
to a particularly busy center of diversified manufacturing enterprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the eleven months to November, 1916, the rent
amounted to $5,517.65 out of a possible $5,676,—the difference
being due to the fact that periods of occupancy did not precisely
overlap. After deducting expenses and interest paid on mortgages
the Model Homes Company was able to show a profit of $1,873.19;
of this sum it set aside $400 for a depreciation account; and it
paid to the Association $1,400, which was a seven per cent. return
on the $20,000 invested by the Association. (See page <a href='#Page_121'>121</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>A rebate of one-half of one month’s rent was made to tenants
who had lived in an apartment or a house a year and done no
careless damage requiring repairs. Trees were planted in the
yard and before the houses, and the occupants have always
evinced a lively interest in their little garden-plots. The nationality
census is interesting. In the first year there were these families:
Scotch, 3, German, 5, French, 2, Norwegian, 5, Swedish, 1,
Italian, 1, American-born, 31 (18 of Irish extraction),—a total
of 48.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1914–15 the Association shared the gratitude of certain
poor families which had no work in sight for the bread-winner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>by arranging with the Emergency Aid Committee to supply the
necessary materials and supervision if the Committee would
provide the wages of laborers and mechanics engaged in repair
work on the properties. Nine men began work on this basis in
February, and fifty at one time were finally employed. The
work was continued until July, when funds were no longer available.
In all, eighty men benefited by the arrangement: seventeen
painters, eight carpenters, fifty-five laborers. From the Emergency
Aid Committee $4,000 was received, and was disbursed
for wages, tools, car-fare and incidental expenses. Two hundred
houses were completely put in order and painted, yards were
repaved, fences were rebuilt, grading was done, and a vacant
area was prepared for gardening purposes. Moreover, men who
knew nothing of plastering or cement work learned how to do
it, and thus acquired a new accomplishment of market value.
They put down floors, relaid walks, whitewashed cellars, and
concreted walls where dampness had exuded. Some of these
men who came as utterly green hands still remain in the employ
of the Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1916 the Whittier Centre, with whose purposes the Association
is wholly in sympathy, carried out a plan for improved
housing facilities for the negro population. The Centre is organized
for the study of this problem, and for practical measures
devised as the outcome thereof. It formed the Whittier Centre
Housing Company, with a capital of $25,000, which took title
to property at Dickinson and Opal Streets. The planning and
construction of the first group of houses was put in the hands
of the Association, and Mr. Feld supervised the building of seven
two-family dwellings with apartments of three rooms and bath,
at a rental of $3.00 and $3.50 a week. As an indication of the
lively demand for such cleanly and attractive quarters, it should
be noted that there were two hundred applications for the fourteen
apartments available.</p>

<p class='c011'>That this enterprise pays is shown by the fact that in midsummer
of 1917 a dividend of 5 per cent. was paid.</p>

Seventh and Eighth, and in the vicinity. Here simple rooms
may be had for a couple at the low figure of 80 cents a week, or
$1.00 for larger rooms. The standard of self-respect and cleanliness
among the tenants is high. Many of the houses were formerly
dens of the lowest order, and the Association does not relax its
vigil to prevent a recurrence to former conditions. In all there
were, in 1917, <a href='#Page_125'>125</a> colored families in houses owned or controlled
by the Association. It is probable that in the near future the
Association will take over other properties west of Broad Street
and south of Lombard in the district into which negroes are
moving. The Association is hopeful of doing much more in the
future to help the negroes find good homes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The number of houses owned by the Association at the beginning
of 1917 was 179; the number of families in these houses
was 244. The agency properties in charge of the Association
numbered 224, and there were 460 families housed in them. This
gives a total of 704 families in 403 dwellings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agency properties have been handled by the Association,
to the expressed satisfaction of owners, since it was in the second
year of its existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association charges 7½ per cent. for its management;
a charge fully justified by the quantity and the quality of its
executive supervision.</p>

<p class='c011'>The properties handled for others may be thus classified:
first, houses received from owners who built with an intent frankly
philanthropic, and who realized that the Association was
qualified by experience to run these properties to the greater
advantage of owner and tenant; second, houses bought at the
suggestion of the Association and left in its hands for reconstruction
and management; third, houses held as ordinary business
investments, and committed to the oversight of the Association
for the sake of an assured lucrative result; fourth, houses received
from trust companies or estates; fifth, houses turned over by
charitable or philanthropic institutions which have received
them as bequests.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the last connection, it is to be observed that the legacy
is made to perform a twofold service. Low-wage families are
assured a good home at a small cost; and the legatee receives a
return which may be put to philanthropic uses. Of course in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>some cases there is so much to be done to rehabilitate the property
bequeathed that for a time there is no income from it. But the
possible dual objective of a legacy is worth the thoughtful consideration
of those who would have a bequest mean as much as
possible to those who come after them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is seen from this brief review of the impersonal side of the
business operations of the Association that in certain particulars
the procedure of Miss Hill has been modified. Miss Hill relied
largely on volunteer collectors. The Association in addition
to its unpaid collectors employs several who are paid. Miss
Hill obtained purchasers for houses which she desired to improve.
The Association, as a stock company, has purchased outright
a number of houses. It has realized that whereas certain landlords
on a grand scale in London controlled vast areas, in Philadelphia,
aside from the Girard Estate, with its admirable model
homes for persons who can afford them, there are very few owners
of large, undivided tracts where blocks of model houses might
be created. So it has been accustomed to purchase its groups
piecemeal from a number of owners.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is probable that in the future the Association will undertake
to an increasing extent the construction of new dwellings. For
a long time to come, if not always, it will continue to renovate
old dwellings, for the old dwellings, situated in the congested
areas, are the abodes of most of the poor, who are traditionally
averse to uprooting; and often the poor feel much more at home
in an old house “fixed up” than in a new house to which the
adjustment only comes by the slow stages of a social education.
Of course a point is reached, especially on a soaring market for
all building materials, when it pays better to build anew than
to make over the old. The philanthropic side of the Association’s
endeavor will cling to the old houses. The sheer business astuteness
of the enterprise will erect new dwellings. The problem is
to keep the due proportion between the business and the philanthropy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The tenants of the Association are not allowed to sublet or
to take in lodgers without explicit authorization. That this
regulation is sensible is obvious. Any other course would lead
to all the evils of overcrowding and of positive immorality which
the organization was created in large part to fight. The housing
of the single man is not attempted. The Association is aware
of the importance of the bachelor’s problem. It is a matter that
the munition-factories and other industrial plants in quest of
shelter for their employes are daily called upon to consider.
Were its means and its executive facilities less limited, there is
no doubt that the Association would grapple as courageously
and as successfully with this issue of the housing of the single man
as with the problem of the housing of families.</p>

<p class='c011'>Charles H. Ludington, President of the Association, says in
his report for the year 1916: “It is also the desire of the Board
to give as much publicity as possible to the special lines of service
which the Association is now prepared and equipped to offer—(1)
Advice with regard to the restoration to approved standards,
and the altering for profitable use of old or unsanitary dwellings.
(2) Undertaking, after submitting estimates, the entire carrying
out of such improvements and the future supervision and management
of the property for the owners if desired. (3) The management
of residential properties held by institutions or corporations,
insuring for them the maintenance of sanitary and proper conditions,
together with the social service offered to the tenants
by the Association through rent-collectors trained in our methods.
We have frequently been able to render valuable assistance of
this kind both to individual owners and to institutions owning
real estate of this character, which, through neglect or merely
formal management, has deteriorated. Instances have been
brought to our attention where, entirely without the knowledge
of the owners, conditions have existed not merely unsanitary
but also otherwise highly objectionable and which would have
subjected the owners to just criticism. This the standards of
management of our Association will absolutely prevent. (4)
Industrial housing by employers for their employees. The interest
in this subject is showing marked increase, and the Association
is ready to place its experience and facilities at the disposal of
corporations or firms considering the matter, and to prepare
plans, procure estimates and supervise construction, and if desired
to undertake the management of such properties in and about
Philadelphia. (5) Improved housing for wage earners. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>experience and information which the Association has gathered,
especially in recent years, qualifies it in the judgment of the
Board in tendering its services as an expert to anyone who may
be ready to consider this character of investment. There is
unquestionably in our judgment a need in Philadelphia for new
building of this kind, i. e., for dwellings that will rent for under
$15.00 per month. The operating builder is supplying only
houses of a more expensive grade and for quick sale, because
there is more profit in this for him. That sanitary, durable and
comfortable dwellings can be built for rental at less than $15.00
per month, and made to yield under proper management a return
of 5 per cent. has been repeatedly demonstrated in this and other
cities. To any interest that is willing to consider such investment
with the further view of meeting a community need, we should
offer our services. From our own actual experience in this field
and our knowledge of similar undertakings elsewhere, our organization
can, we believe, render valuable help in the planning and
execution of such projects.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>IV<br> DAYS AFIELD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>To read of the work of the “friendly rent-collector” in cold
print is one thing; to feel the pulse of it by personal
contact is another matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. E. R. L. Gould, in a report that he made to the Commissioner
of Labor in 1895 on “The Housing of the Working
People,” described at length Miss Hill’s system of rent-collecting,
which made the process so much more than a soulless, impersonal
proceeding.</p>

<p class='c011'>He said, “There are abundant testimonies to the efficiency
of rent-collecting as practised by Miss Hill. Her system has
been adapted with uniform success in many large cities in Europe
and to a smaller extent in this country.... The moral influence
of Miss Hill’s system has been to admit women to a greater
extent into the management of housing companies, a practice
which has undoubted advantages. Several of the large London
dwelling companies acknowledge that their success, financially
and morally, only began with the introduction of rent-collecting
through lady volunteers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A bad tenant is not turned into a good one merely by a periodic
demand for money. If all tenants were always in comfortable
circumstances, if they never suffered from lack of employment,
if protracted illness disabling the bread-winner of the family
never spelt acute privation for the rest, if every poor and ignorant
foreigner understood from the first his relation to the community
and to society at large, and scrupulously maintained this relation
for his part, the “friendly rent-collector” might be superfluous.
But as conditions stand, the very soul of the Octavia Hill system
is this personal contact which has the business transaction for
its immediate warrant; and by the acid test of business results
its efficacy is demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the great majority of cases the rent-collector does not
have to ask a leading question: the tenants are ready enough
to flock round her and pour their woes into her ear. Her appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>is often the signal for a fusillade of questions, petitions, and<a id='t78'></a>
complaints.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I going to get that paint for my stairway, please ma’am?”
“The rain last week leaked into the cellar something terrible.”
“The water in the backyard won’t drain off. The bricks around
the hydrant has all sunk down.” “It’s been four days since the
man was here to take away the garbage.” “The neighbors keeps
puttin’ ashes in the garbage can, and garbage with the ashes.
Sure I dunno who’s been doin’ it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such are the petty complaints that all the rent-collectors hear
on all their rounds. These matters might be considered to be
wholly within the domain of the superintendent and his mechanics.
But the tenants do not differentiate. Their appeal is to anyone
who may be supposed to be connected with the Association.
Sometimes they ask modestly, meekly. Sometimes they ask
in accents of more or less defiant challenge. Miss Hill herself
describes how she was locked into a room by an irate woman
who said she wouldn’t pay the rent till the mantel was repaired,
in a house so recently taken over by the new landlady that there
had not been an opportunity to attend to the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The friendly rent-collector bides her time, keeps her tongue
behind her teeth, and makes allowances for the previous condition
of servitude to low ideals and to grasping landlords, which
has been that of many of her charges.</p>

<p class='c011'>The real reward of the work to the right sort of worker is in
this lively, daily chance to meet the people and to help them
in their problems by the service that is better than the outright
gift of money.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, for a trivial instance, we come to a humble door where
the rent is due, and a poor man has great boxes of laces which
he means to move upstairs and store where he lives. There is
really no space for the stuff in the one room that he shares with
wife and baby. He plans to sell his wares from his cart beside the
curbstone on the morrow. The boxes are nearly as big as an
upright piano. He cannot afford another place for storage. That
is his problem. To you and to me, living in a whole house, the
advent of such boxes would be nothing to worry about. But if
this vendor can’t secure from the friendly rent-collector a suspension of the unwritten rule against overcrowding his small
space, he is in a grievous predicament.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>A few minutes later we find a whole court in an uproar over
an incident that would mean little to those of us who have gardens
of size and gardeners of skill. One of the fathers living in the
court—a one-armed man—has spent a blistering Sunday afternoon
inducing morning-glories to cling to the strings he has put
up against the high board fence. The little plot of ground on
which his plants grew was perhaps thirty feet long, and a foot
and a half wide. He took pride in the result, and his neighbors
praised it. When his back was turned a little Polish child of two,
living next door, came trotting along, pulled down the wire
netting he had arranged in front, and tore off the vines that he
had laboriously twisted round the strings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The indignant neighbors insist, in conclave, that the mother
stood in the doorway laughing while the child wrought this mischief.
To the friendly rent-collector the mother, with small
English but with a profusion of gesture, explains her injured
innocence. After long and excited parley, in which everyone
who is at home in the court takes part, peace is restored, and the
tactful mediator leaves behind her smiles and good humor in
place of sullen resentment.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this case the chief complaint the neighbors brought was
that the mother—who was supposed to know so little of our
tongue—had used such <span class='fss'>AWFUL</span> language!</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t use to be a good woman myself,” said another mother
in this court. “My mother didn’t use to be a good woman,
either. But now my daughter’s comin’ on, and I want her to
be different. I want her to be a Christian. She sings hymns
somethin’ lovely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In an Italian yard near by are old railway-ties high piled,
to be chopped into kindling. In their enthusiasm for saving
money, the householders are likely to fill the court as high as
the roofs with the beams, if not restrained by the rent-collector’s
timely warning that they must leave some room for other purposes.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the houses shows menacing patches of brown specks
on the plastering of a tiny bedroom—that means the larvæ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>vermin. In a hole in the midst of each patch are the live insects.
The friendly rent-collector makes a careful note of the fact.
There is an evil day in store for this common pest of the tenants
in old houses, when the Association shall bring its batteries of
formidable disinfectants to bear. The Association is not fond
of spreading wall-paper over the surfaces where insects live and
thrive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here is a young man with a moral inheritance that the friendly
rent-collector knows by heart. He has a job slicing bacon with
a meat-packing concern. Today is a holiday, he explains. Query:
will he hold down the job, or go on drifting? The fever of the
wandering ne’er-do-weel burns in his veins. His father is a dipsomaniac,
who runs amuck periodically with a carving-knife and
finds his foes in his own household. He once killed a man and
escaped to an adjoining State. Detectives caught him and he
was lodged in the “Pen.” He blamed his wife for it, and sent
her letters demanding $80 for a shyster lawyer to get him out.
He sent her pictures of caskets, as portents of her fate when he
should finally emerge from durance vile.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last she raised the money and got him out. He wept on
the doorstep—the neighbors, whose heads were at all the windows,
said he shed buckets—and she took pity on him and abandoned
her design of procuring a separation. He has been home for a
few days, and on this particular day husband and wife are off
on a picnic together. The son knows all the story. How long
is the peace to last? Will the boy in time follow in the erratic
footsteps of the father?</p>

<p class='c011'>Here is another sinister family history that faces the visitor.
The mother is feeble-minded. There are five children. Two of
the boys and two of the girls inherit the maternal defect. The
other child, a girl, is normal. The father works by fits and starts.
A former source of income to the family was a woman boarder
of bad character. The Society for Organizing Charity and the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have interested
themselves in these derelicts, and the Octavia Hill Association
is trying to help.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another kind of trouble constantly cropping up is that of
the victims of rascally insurance-agents. They turned over their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>books to the agents to keep. The agents took the money and
either did not enter the sums or recorded them incorrectly. In
some cases those who expected an old-age pension or at least
their burial expenses will not get a cent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” someone may ask, “what has this humanitarian effort
to do with rents and dividends? Couldn’t the money be obtained
and no questions asked, no advice given, no ‘hard-luck stories’
heard? Business is business. Let the charitable societies, the
soup kitchens, the Salvation Army or what you will, look out for
the other side of the matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The answer to this contention is that a conscientious landlord
can hardly be satisfied to accept money from any sort of house
without knowing or caring how it is obtained. Several times
in the experience of the Association the owners of houses which
had descended to base uses were shocked and grieved inexpressibly
to learn of it. In one instance a good lady residing in England
who had never seen the property managed by her agents in Philadelphia
couldn’t believe the tales that were told her concerning
its condition. The agents themselves were unaware of the facts
until the Association reported to them the lively horrors. Owner
and agents alike were glad to have the houses pass into the control
of the Association, which at once converted them into dwellings
which no longer were a blot on the ’scutcheon of the City of
Homes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The question of repairs, when the tenants make their requests
or the rent-collector’s inspection discovers places where they
may be needed, is a matter determined by urgency, and by the amount
of money already expended on the property, and by the evinced
cooperative spirit of the tenant. It stands to reason that slovenly
and destructive occupants are not accorded the same attention
that is given to the representatives of those who are clean and
careful and prompt in their payments. What a difference there
may be on opposite sides of a thin partition-wall! On this side
of the wall is a family inclined to dirt and disorder, because of
its unperfected social education. On the other side of the wall,
only a few inches away, the floor, neatly carpeted, is spotless.
The center-table holds a gaudy lamp, or a vase of dried grasses,
or lurid paper flowers. There are pictures on the walls, of saints
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>or landscapes or the family, in crayon,—perhaps the bridal
couple arm-in-arm, or the head of the house in the gorgeous uniform
of a Polish benefit association.</p>

<p class='c011'>One may find the bureau turned into a shrine, with a crucifix
and candles; or perhaps the royal family of Italy is a prized
possession in a glorious flamboyancy of colors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rent-collector refers all-important questions of improvements
to the superintendent for his decision. Part of her special
care it is to see that the plumbing is in good order. The Octavia
Hill Association is largely responsible for the considerable reduction
of the number of cases in which six or eight or a dozen families
in a court live off the same hydrant. In one court visited, a pet
dog had been giving considerable trouble, since he had learned to
turn on the water himself, and would leave it running.</p>

<p class='c011'>Garbage and ashes come under the rent-collector’s supervision,
too. When the former is thrown where the latter should
be, it becomes necessary to inquire more particularly who had
watermelon for dinner, who had chicken, and who had corn-ears—perhaps
at a dollar a dozen. In one case where an orthodox
Jewish family was blamed by neighbors, the supposed culprits
were exonerated by the discovery of a ham-bone in the can when
the lid was lifted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as the work of a Red Cross nurse in a war-hospital is a
different matter from a debutante’s dream of it, so the inspection
by the rent-collector may become a very plain and prosaic, undecorative
business indeed. She has to see, to think, to know.
Nothing is too small for her attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “Conditions of Tenancy” printed in the monthly rent
book which the collector carries for receipts, gives the rules she
must enforce. All rents must be paid promptly in advance.
The tenant will be required to pay for any damage due to his or
her own carelessness. The tenant must replace glass broken
in the windows, if it is the tenant’s fault. Lodgers must not be
taken nor rooms sublet without the collector’s written permission.
Cellars and yards are to be kept free from rubbish, and no animals
are allowed in the premises. Garbage and ashes must be kept
separate, and rubbish and paper must have their own receptacles.
Tenants must keep the sidewalk clean and free from obstruction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and must attend to the removal of ice and snow. Nails or hooks
must not be driven in the woodwork without permission, and
nothing is to be built in the yard. Each tenant is responsible
for a set of keys, which must be surrendered upon vacating. In
tenement houses each tenant must do his or her share in cleaning
halls, stairs and yards.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are also explicit suggestions for the care of bathrooms,
kitchens, plumbing and garbage cans. There is a brief direction
printed on the inside of the cover for the collector’s ready reference,
giving the addresses and the office-hours of various dispensaries,
hospitals and other institutions which may be a present help in
time of need to the tenants.</p>

<p class='c011'>A colored woman on her knees scrubbing a floor that already
seemed clean, explained that one couldn’t be too “pertickler
about them germs.” The germs, she explained, were so small
you couldn’t see them, but they certainly could raise a dreadful
rumpus inside a person or a home. She did not know of Metchnikoff
or Pasteur or Lister, but she grasped the important idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>A janitor for a house or a group of houses may be appointed
by the Association from among the tenants, at a nominal fee—taking
the form, perhaps, of a dollar a month subtracted from
the rent. The janitor takes charge of the garbage and the ashcans,
and cleans out the houses that are to be rented. She sees
to it that the tenants sweep their rooms and hallways and stairs,
each doing a part of the premises used in common. The janitor
is encouraged to consider herself a working partner of the Association,
and she is usually proud of her post.</p>

<p class='c011'>An important part of the collector’s duty is to ascertain and
report damage done to plumbing. The plumber also notifies
the Association of any damage that is to be traced to the tenant,
and the latter defrays part of the cost of repairs by instalments
till the whole amount has been paid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Careful calculation showed that in a group of 140 families,
for one year, the cost of repairs for plumbing due to the tenants’
carelessness was $32. The real estate officer of a large trust
company declared this an excellent record.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the rent-collector of tact and insight makes her rounds
the mechanical transaction of requesting and receipting for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>rent is accomplished frictionlessly and with dispatch in the great
majority of instances. The services of the constable, at a cost
of $2.00, to dispossess a family are rarely and very regretfully
called into requisition. But the Association stands for no shillyshallying.
It requires prompt payment. It insists that those
who occupy its houses shall fulfil the few simple regulations it
has established. It does not hesitate to invoke the arm of the
law when the need arises, and the tenants soon become aware
of the fact. Most of them, happy to be under a fair and considerate
landlord, are punctual, peaceful and contented. “I’ll never
get another landlord like you,” said an old Jew, compelled for
reasons of his own to move, as he trudged dolefully away wagging
his beard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cases in which the Association has to proceed to the
extreme penalty of eviction may be similar to that of the woman
who represented herself as a widow with four children. The
children were mythical. She took in four male boarders, in
flagrant defiance of the strict rule that forbids taking boarders
or subletting without the Association’s consent. There was
nothing to do but to put her out, inexorably.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rent-collector takes with her wherever she goes her moneybag,
containing a small card-catalogue to check off payments,
which are entered in the office ledgers, receipt-books, blank
forms for leases, and paper for memoranda. Sometimes tenants
who fail to have the sum ready when the call is made promise
to bring it to the office, and rarely do they fail to keep their word.
Italians are particularly punctilious in their payments. The man
who after an absence of two months came back and paid up for
the whole time, though there were a few days he was not, bound
to pay for, saying proudly, “I am an honorable gentleman,” was
merely typical of his compatriots.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Ordinarily it is not the great crises of life and death that
confront the sympathetic rent-collector. But she never can tell
what will meet her round the corner. Here sits a man who was
for years a baker, and he is utterly forlorn. His sister bustles
cheerfully about the room, making as brave a pretence of keeping
a home as she can with some sorry sticks of furniture and a few
cracked dishes. The ailing brother has just come back from the
hospital, and there is a package wrapped in a bit of Polish newspaper
on the table before him. The rent-collector unwraps from
it a brown bottle of medicine bearing the label of the Polish
doctor to whom he had gone straight from the contrary hospital
advice, to secure a nostrum for his heart-trouble. He insists
that he never will return to that hospital which kept him in bed
so long and did nothing for him. He will never be able to work
again, he reiterates monotonously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who have labored in France among soldiers blinded
in war, to restore a hopeful mood in which a man takes hold on
life again, know what means a wise, kind woman will use with
a discouraged man who finds his cross too heavy to carry and
has succumbed to a melancholy listlessness. She brings him
round by degrees to a more rational frame of mind, and in place
of the closed door she shows him an open window. Was not the
result worth tarrying for, a few minutes? Even from the commercial
point of view is anything gained by having tenants who
are at odds with destiny, or anæmic, if not acutely ill, from bad
air, bad smells, foul vaults and cellars, surface drainage and
contaminated food? Was not Miss Hill entirely right when she
declared that tenants and their surroundings must be improved
together?</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was another trouble to be adjusted by the patient
universal arbiter. Italian children sat on Polish steps and refused
to be dislodged. Out of a cloud no bigger than a child’s uplifted
hand came a storm that threatened to destroy the peace of the
street. Five nations presently swept into the melee. No great
matter, you say—but even so the world-war started.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wagon drivers for the meat packers’ distributing houses
struck for a dollar a week more. A little butcher couldn’t afford
to let his chopping block stay idle. He borrowed a push-cart and
a neighbor helped him and he fetched the meat himself, running
the gauntlet of the angry teamsters. But that is the reason, if
you please, that he hasn’t the rent today. There is so often the
slenderest margin between a sufficiency and dire distress in the
case of the poor. To most of us a strike is in the newspapers.
To them a strike is in their lives—it may come like a bolt of
lightning crashing through the roof to disrupt a home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Perhaps the reckless joy-rider or motor-truck driver will
never know how many little children are kept within doors by
their mothers for fear they will be run over if they play in the
street. But the rent-collector knows. There are so many children
shrieking and sprawling over the cobbles already that it doesn’t
seem as though there could be any left in any of the houses. But
there are always plenty more. Here are some, too tiny to be
allowed to go to the city swimming-baths. In the heat of summer
they wear scarcely any clothes, and their puny limbs stick out
from their tattered garments like twigs from a bird’s nest. They
sit here in the darkened room where their mother is sewing on
trousers which she “finishes” at nine cents a pair. The mother
explains that she doesn’t dare let them go out into the street—they
might get run over. So here they sit, listless, pale, forlorn.
They laugh outright when you play a child’s game on your fingers
for them, and are loath to have you go.</p>

<p class='c011'>In another house sits a fair-haired girl with blue eyes, one of
them sadly atwist, and a scrofulous disfigurement marking what
is almost a pretty face. She is perhaps fourteen years old. You
start to talk to her and you find she is deaf and dumb. She has
been at a school for such unfortunates, the rent-collector explains,
and this is her summer vacation. It is certainly vacant enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here are houses just about to be transferred to the Association.
Italians, mostly, occupy them. Notice the English sparrow
that flutters into a crevice of the bricks, where it wholly disappears
as it finds its nest. There is the common phenomenon
of one hydrant outside, for half-a-dozen families. In a dark
angle of a yard, behind a woodshed cluttered and foul, there is
a pool of stinking black water out of which you can fish rotten
burlap and odds and ends of the social history of all the houses.
The curious children have turned pale green, like sprouts in a
cellar, and their arms are thin as pipestems. The stench that
emanates from the pool seems to have something to do with it.
The mother says—somewhat proudly—that a doctor has said
that her children have sluggish livers. She looks at you with a
furrowed brow as she wipes her hands in her apron. She is wondering
whether there is any hope of anything better in the way
you are looking at her. “The landlord,” she says, not knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of the change to another regime that is imminent, “never does
nothin’ to the place but just collect the rent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A few years ago behind the rear wall of a large church there
was a pocket that those who praised God on the other side of the
wall knew nothing about. It adjoined a court of nine houses
which the Octavia Hill Association had acquired and improved.
Through the court the inmates of the four evil and invisible
dwellings made their hasty escape to the street when the law
was on the trail that the gospel never found. The owner was
a well-to-do negro, who was content to take his money from an
agent and ask no questions. The agent was appealed to, again
and again, to put an end to the bedlam of drink and gambling,
of fighting and obscenity that made night hideous on the premises.
Providentially the owner died and the houses were bought by
a friend of the Association who turned them over to its care.
There was nothing to do but to evict the tenants. Polish immigrants
of the poorest were put in. In the first year after the
change the rent-collector was able to show every cent collected.
In the second year the result was the same. In the meantime
the Association received its usual 7½ per cent. commission for
collecting the rents and the owners received in the first year 6.4
per cent. and in the second year 6.5 per cent. on the investment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another striking object-lesson among many that might be
cited as to the value of the quiet influence of the rent-collector—an
influence that permeates as subtly as yeast—is to be seen
in the group of houses for the negro population on Naudain
Street near the offices of the Association, to which reference has
already been made. One of these houses, since it is given over
to single old women, has come to be called the “Old Ladies’
Home.” Would one find exemplary contentment let him talk
with an old crippled, blind woman who lives on the top floor.
“She is able to iron a shirt-waist without a wrinkle,” says the
friendly rent-collector. The order and the cleanliness of these
rooms is remarkable. There are stories of the plantation-life
to be heard at the lips of the old-time “Mammy” of Dixieland.
There are the manners of the great houses that have become
historic landmarks, and of the days before “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”
was written. The whole House of Bishops of the A. M. E. Church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>has to find room on the walls somewhere, and you will discover
that devout communicants are on their knees every night for
the younger generation who may fall a prey to the lures of the
Devil along the Great Black Way of South Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the all-important role of the Superintendent, it is hard
to see where his work begins or ends. There are just as many
troubles as he will give ear to. Here is a Jewish woman who
turns loose a flood of appeal and interrogation and never stops,
when either the rent-collector or the superintendent comes in
sight. All she wants is all there is to want; only a “blue sky”
concession would satisfy her claims. But behind all this importunity
is maternal ambition. A piano in the house, and the
daughter’s lessons, mean stinting for all the rest, as in the case
of a home—not controlled by the Association—where a druggist’s
clerk lives and we find the kitchen range, the dinner-table and
a Steinway baby-grand crowded together in one small room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association has its own force of mechanics, for work old
and new, and the superintendent is their “boss.” They have a
repair shop in the basement of the office at 613–15 Lombard
Street for any work that is not to be done on the premises. There
they keep supplies of small hardware, paint and lumber to be
used as the call comes.</p>

<p class='c011'>These mechanics attend to everything except the plumbing,
the roof-repairs, and the larger operations that involve considerable
plastering and brickwork. The plumbing is always as simple
as it can be, and when it is once installed the maintenance chiefly
means keeping the drains to the sinks and toilets in working
order.</p>

<p class='c011'>When houses are taken over for alteration, galvanized sinks
with slate backs are put in, except that in the better houses one-piece
enameled iron sinks are used. The water supply, run
through galvanized pipe, issues at brass spigots. Not much
lead pipe is used—it is tempting to thieves. The sink taps are
iron.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the first things to do to an old house toward its rehabilitation
is to scrape off the paper. The Association has no love
of many thicknesses of paper concealing long neglect and the
insidious lairs of insects, and it generally applies paint or calcimine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>instead. Ten or twelve coats of paper are common, and
as many as twenty-seven have been removed from the walls of
one room. When the walls are scraped the breaks in the plaster
are likely to be alive with the vermin. The walls are painted
or calcimined in light tones that make an agreeable contrast
with the woodwork. Many tenants want paper, but they can
be taught in time the sanitary advantage of the alternative.</p>

<p class='c011'>The exterior brickwork, frequently buckling and crumbling,
requires much attention, and often many feet of new wall must
be built, or a wall entirely replaced. Broken doors and rotting
window-frames and sashes are frequent items of expense. It is
a mistake to renew glass in a sash too weak to hold it. A new
sash is a truer economy in the long run than one that is patched
up “to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It might look as though in the case of a wrecked window-blind
(usually blinds are not found on Association houses) or a
worn-out washer for a spigot the tenant might display sufficient
initiative to attend to the necessary repairs himself; but there
are so many ways of doing things wrong and of damaging Association
property that the Superintendent actually prefers to
have the tenants let things alone till he and his own men can come.</p>

<p class='c011'>A three story house at 1326 Kenilworth Street might be
chosen as an apt example of the superintendent’s reconstructive
work. The rental of the house before the Association took charge
was $16 a month. It was sublet to negro tenants who paid in
all about $50 a month for their quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is now being rearranged for two-room apartments, one on
each floor, which will rent for eight dollars a floor per month,
the rent payable in weekly instalments. There is a toilet on
each floor, and there is a sink in each kitchen. Superfluous partitions
that prevented the free circulation of light and air have
been taken out. A gesture of the superintendent’s arms, as
though he were lashing out in a gymnastic exercise, told one
more than his words. “I must get light and air,” he said; and
one thought of Octavia Hill’s insistence on this point.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of a row of little houses in the rear is $8 a month. The
former owner put in a few cheap articles of furniture and collected
$20 a month. Under the Association the furniture is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of the tenants. Improvements now being installed will add a
dollar a month to the rent. These little houses are called “one,
two, three houses,” because they are of three rooms only, one
over another.</p>

<p class='c011'>What an oasis we find here, as we look from the upper windows!
The houses round about—not Association property—have ruinous
shacks at the rear that hold broken boxes and barrels, superannuated
chairs and bedding and broken-down baby carriages.
There is no clear space to sit under a shade-tree, or plant morning-glories,
or put a sandpile. One longs to see the workmen who
are paving the Octavia Hill courtyard below turn their attention
to the whole vicinity.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the case of the property at 948–952 North Third Street,
from six privy-wells in the court, which extended partly under
the kitchens, one hundred barrels of filth in each case were taken.
From another well, ten feet in diameter and twenty-five in depth,
275 barrels were taken. The figures convey some slight idea of
the superintendent’s task as sanitary engineer. The men, overcome
by the stench of these vaults which had not been thoroughly
cleaned—it is said—in eighty years, worked in relays to obtain
the necessary breathing-spells.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were disreputable tenants when the Association came
to this court; tenants who had influence with powers political
and defied the new administration to oust them. A law unto
themselves, they made night both hideous and dangerous to
respectable neighbors. The drinking, brawling, immoral occupants
had to go, and today’s tenants are a very different sort.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Serb who inhabits one of the houses in the cement-paved
court at the rear is secretary of his lodge, and describes with
pride the school for thirty Serbian children which he and his
countrymen have started at Third and Brown Streets near by.
In another house a woman is making some embroidery to be
sold for her church. She has been working on stems for artificial
leaves to trim hats, and she has made $3.50 to $5.00 a week
laboring from dawn to dark, at two cents and a half for a gross
of stems. But she is happy because she has a good husband,
and this is pin-money. The children of another house have taken
a cast-iron bath-tub and made for themselves a joyous swimmingpool with a few feet of hose provided by their father. No wonder
is it that former residents who recently returned to the court
to visit failed to recognize the place, and were about to retreat
abashed as trespassers. At the back of the court is a good example
of the wire fence installed in many places in place of the solid
board fence, to permit of the free circulation of air. It should
be noted that the solid blinds of old-time Philadelphia dwellings
are similar undesirable barriers to the medicinal out-of-doors.
So many tenants need to be taught the therapeutic virtues of
fresh air!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Damp walls constitute a serious problem for the superintendent.
Tenants constantly complain of leakage into cellars.
Often the water collecting against the sashes of cellar windows
or seeping under them rots the sashes. If plastering is done
directly on brick walls, the dampness will come through in cold
weather and appear in the form of “sweating” on the inside.
Much experimentation has developed the fact that the cheapest
and most satisfactory procedure is to give the walls several applications
of the substance known as tunlin. In some places this
has been in use three years on the walls and still keeps the moisture
from coming through.</p>

<p class='c011'>By paying cash or by discounting its bills the Association
has become a desired customer, and the superintendent keeps
his eye out for a rise in prices or the possibility of a good bargain.</p>

<p class='c011'>For instance, in the Kenilworth Street houses we note that
the new window-sashes are of bass wood, a good-looking and
easily-handled material. It now costs considerable more than
it did a little while ago. We find that the superintendent, before
the price soared, bought a quantity for $15 that would now
cost $200 at least. It is, he explains, soft enough to work in, old
enough to have dried out, and the best possible material for
satisfactory mitre-joints.</p>

<p class='c011'>We find that he bought twenty-five kegs of nails, in anticipation
of the rise, two days before there was an advance in price
of 40 cents a keg. When it is necessary in all ways to keep down
prices for the sake of low rents, and the dividing-line between
profit and loss is so precisely drawn, a saving of $10 on one such
transaction is no trifling affair.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Nor does the Association save by cheating its tenants as the
former landlord did in the house where the twenty-seven thicknesses
of wall-paper were removed. It was found that this particular
miscreant had used manure instead of hair as a binder
for the plaster.</p>

<p class='c011'>By standardizing the various minor hardware a further saving
is effected. There are rim locks of uniform pattern for the outside
of the door, mortise locks of one type for the inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>The paint is of much the same color. That means a match
is readily obtainable without making a special mixture.</p>

<p class='c011'>All houses are fitted up for gas, an inexpressible relief to the
housekeeper who must otherwise face the hot range in summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every effort is made to conserve the backyard trees, and it
is the superintendent’s favorite theory that these trees are meant
to be sat under and played under, as well as to shade the windows
and the courts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association in its office-building at 613–15 Lombard
Street utilizes the first floor for its own purposes, and rents the
two upper floors to careful tenants. The repair shop in the basement
has been mentioned. All day long the tenants of every
race, and condition come to pay the rent or to seek light upon the
wide range of personal and social problems indicated in the preceding
pages. They are given to feel that the office is their office,
and that a deaf ear will never be turned to anyone who really
needs and honestly deserves counsel. They are receiving free
of charge—though they may be unaware of the fact—a business
and a social education. They find the data bearing on their
individual cases card-catalogued, and if they should be guilty
of evasion, an accurate system of book-keeping will bring them
to confusion. No record of a transaction in the business of the
Association depends upon haphazard recollection or mere say-so.
The office-hours are conducted without fuss or flurry, the
floors are spotless, the desks are cleared for action. Waste motion
is eliminated, the virtues of thrift and of system are illustrated,
and still there is heart and human feeling in the enterprise. It
is not possible to visit the headquarters without realizing at once
the atmosphere of sincerity and diligence and practical success
that surrounds the work. It is philanthropy; and it is business.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>V<br> DOES IT PAY?</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Now we come to the question—does it pay? Obviously
there are two sides to the answer, one the material, the
other the spiritual. Let us consider, in the first place,
the actual cash return.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have already cited the satisfactory financial results in
the case of a few typical properties. It is a postulate that those
who are looking for the largest possible dividend on an investment
without regard to any other consideration will scarcely
be satisfied with the 4 per cent. which the Association is paying.
The stockholders of the Association and the directors as a rule
are glad to realize that their investment is providing good homes
for the poor at low cost, and they are content to forego the somewhat
higher profits that might accrue if nobody cared how the
tenants lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trust company, in behalf of an estate, had charge of a group
of small houses erected as model homes for the poor. Under the
trust company’s management, the average gross income from
these houses for three years was $72 per month and the net income
was $14.34 per month. The property came under the
control of the Association. During the first two years under the
new order the gross income was $148, and the net income was
$70. The trust company, far from the scene, sent a clerk or
depended on the services of a local real estate agent. Neither
personally interested himself in the welfare of a tenant. The
Association sent the friendly rent-collector who immediately
reported the need of repairs, watched the workmen, stood at all
times in the closest personal relation to the living problem of
the householder, and obtained good tenants as soon as vacancies
occurred, thus reducing to a minimum the losses due to unlets.</p>

<p class='c011'>We see that under the system of absentee landlordism the
net returns were about a fifth of the gross receipts, while under
the system of constant personal vigilance the net returns were
about one-half of the gross income.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The inherent possibilities of the Association’s system extended
to Chambers of Commerce or Boards of Trade or Women’s Clubs
are almost infinite. One of the best rent-collectors the Association
has had says that the essential things are “to know the
value of money and of punctuality, a little housekeeping, a little
home-making—the rest will come in the doing.” Collectors
of this type, in the employ of the Association, could give invaluable
aid as agents to trust companies and other organizations
that occupy a fiduciary relation toward the owners of property
in the congested areas.</p>

<p class='c011'>The organization and operation of the Model Homes Company,
formed to build the group of houses in the Richmond district,
have been described. To show how closely, from long experience,
the Association figures on the cost of repairs and other expenses,
a leaf may be taken from the account books of the Model Homes
Company. These estimates and actual costs are, except as noted,
for a year ending November 29, 1916.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here is another example of the profitable handling of houses
that had seen better days.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1903 the Association bought as agent two four-story brick
houses about half occupied by a low class of negroes. Everything
within and without was as bad as it could be. The houses
had been converted from private residences into tenements without
the knowledge of the city authorities. Behind the larger
houses were six of the little “one, two, three” houses, all served
by one hydrant. The owners had relied entirely on an agent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>who cared for nothing but the rents. When at last they saw
what they had on their hands they were horrified, and parted
with it for a lower price than they had named at first—$4,870.26.
The alterations and repairs came to $3,214.06. The ground rent
was $1,700. The insurance was $45.00. Five per cent. commission
to the Association for making repairs added $160.70, giving
a total cost of $9,990.02.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now let us see what the Association got out of it, after putting
in toilet facilities, skylights and windows, repairing roofs and
rain conductors, plastering the walls and painting the woodwork,
providing fire-escapes and making all minor repairs. In the
larger houses the weekly rents were 78 cents per room, and in
the smaller 55 cents per room, or $1.65 for the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rents in the first year, 1904, were $1,210.95. Taxes were
$126.21; water rents, $41.50; repairs, $174.37; 7½ per cent.
commission to the Association, $90.80. This gave a balance to
the owner of $778.07, or a net return of 7.7 per cent. on the investment.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year following the rents were $1,203.55, and the balance
to the owner was $822.81, or 8.2 per cent. net on the investment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Association does not expect to show a return greater
than 4 per cent.; it does not promise even this. It finds it advisable
in some cases to withhold a return for a time and turn
back what profits there may be into the improvement of the
property. This has been done by the express desire of the owners
in certain instances. A temporary stringency of the market and
the high cost of building materials or of labor are conditions
that are instantly reflected in the balance sheet of an organization
traveling on so close a margin. But prudent husbandry has
made it possible to show that while the return in exceptional
instances has fallen below four per cent. it has frequently risen
to double or nearly double that figure. We have seen that on
the League Street houses in the Second Ward the return soon
after occupation was 7.5 per cent. per annum, and these were
houses in an exceedingly dilapidated condition. The North
Third Street property from which the hundreds of barrels of
filth were taken showed a return of six per cent. in the first year.</p>

<p class='c011'>The total income of the Association for 1916 was $26,496.23.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>From rentals there accrued $18,834.23; the agency commissions
totalled $3,792.84; the dividend on Model Homes Company
stock was $1,400.00; commissions on new construction and renovation
planned and supervised for other owners amounted to $2,469.16.
As the expenses of operation came to $17,799.26, the net
earnings for the year were $8,696.97. The dividend of 4 per cent.
payable February 1, 1917 left a small balance of $13.26 to add
to the outstanding surplus of $15,973.01,—a surplus chiefly
created by gifts and bequests to the Association.</p>

<p class='c011'>It should be noted that the above showing is made in spite
of certain adverse circumstances. Materials and labor had risen
in price. The sum of $896.40 was charged against the year’s
earnings for repair work undertaken in cooperation with the
Emergency Aid Committee. A capital stock tax of one-half
of one per cent., collected on the entire issued capital, covered
a period of 14 months and amounted to very nearly $1,200.
Under such conditions as these it would have been impossible
to maintain the four per cent. dividend without the commissions
earned on the planning and supervision of new construction and
initial renovation of agency properties, as well as the customary
agency fees. There is no doubt that the Association, which is
very distinctly a philanthropic institution to which the business
administration is incidental, should be relieved of the heavy
burden of the capital stock tax. The dividends the Association
periodically declares are paid to attract investors in dwellings
for the poor. They are not earned for the sake of enabling those
who own small houses to amass a fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such work as that of the Octavia Hill Association brings
returns that are beyond the immediate cash appraisal, and
creates a satisfaction deeper than any that has to do with the
dollar-sign. In scores of American cities that are now planning
good homes at low rates for earners of modest wages, made necessary
by the rapid expansion of industrial interests, it is realized
that it is fundamental to civic prosperity, as well as to individual
felicity, to give the people who are not rich the fullest measure
of comfort and happiness procurable for what they are able to
pay. The public is learning day by day what it has a right to
expect, and is finding out that the corruption of politics, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>pretending to confer a benefit, often perpetrates the rankest
fraud. The taxpayer, intelligently informed, is demanding the
worth of his contribution to the city treasury. The children
in school are acquiring that salutary discontent with things as
they are and that spirit of intelligent interrogation that are the
conditions precedent to human progress. For it is rightly said
that asking questions is the beginning of reform.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such an understanding as that which the Octavia Hill Association
promotes between landlord and tenant pays dividends in
the supreme pleasure it is to any wise and kind trustee of great
wealth to know that his money is easing the burden of living
for the humble toiler. The absentee landlord, content with an
agent’s accounting, who does not care to take the trouble to see
who occupies his houses and what kind of houses are occupied,
can never realize the cordial satisfaction that one who takes an
intimate personal interest in his property experiences.</p>

<p class='c011'>The investment is in so much more than bricks and mortar,
concrete and cast iron. It is an investment in human lives, and
it underwrites the welfare of the city, the country, the world in
the age to come by assuring the health and happiness of the unborn.
If he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew
before is a benefactor, then what is he who tears down a ramshackle
tenement and rears in its place such a house as the Casa
Ravello, where many families enjoy the privileges of privacy
and individuality, or a group of houses such as those in the Richmond
district, where the children have abundant play room and
each occupant controls half his house, or a small home for one
family of which so many examples are entered on the books of
the Association in various localities and at varying prices, all
within a modest range?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Octavia Hill investor can be very sure his dividend does
not come from living conditions that it would perturb an active
conscience to know about. There is nothing that need fear
exploitation. A constant prophylactic scrutiny prevents those
living conditions that are the shame of every city that in this
twentieth century tolerates them.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the Association were engaged in its blest business for the
money only, it could not have enlisted through all these years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the intense interest of so many who have realized in their own
experience the correlation of the kind of house a person lives in
and the kind of character that is therein developed. Too long
have we taken it for granted that the poor love to live poorly: a
survival of the mediæval tradition that only the nobles had noble
emotions, and that the crowd merely existed as a foil to the luminous
brave deeds of a chivalry monopolized by the upper classes.
Today we feel that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The best things any mortal hath</div>
      <div class='line'>Are those that every mortal shares,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>and in that faith those who know what it means to have “the
social conscience” plan and act.</p>

<p class='c011'>Year after year the Annual Reports of the Octavia Hill Association
have presented with brevity and precision the summation
of the progress in the twelve months. Here are set down the
statement of net earnings, the explanation of unusual expenditures,
the current history of properties long in possession of the
Association or newly acquired, the transfer of property for any
reason, the peculiar problems that have presented themselves,
the formation of subsidiary or contributory bodies, the particular
objectives in view or the directions in which the Association is
prepared to offer especially helpful service. The audited Treasurer’s
Report appended enables one to see in its clear and simple
presentment where every cent has gone, and what the return
has been on the Agency Account for each property. But for
all the explicit story, one still must read between the lines to
comprehend completely what has been going on in each of the
homes which—without an odious paternalism—has come under
the trained and keen observation of the friendly rent-collector
and the executive superintendent.</p>

<p class='c011'>The question of whether the enterprise pays or not is put on
the highest ground by those who best understand what the Association
is not merely trying to do but effectually doing. Go to
the little Hector McIntosh playground and watch the children
laughing and caroling in the swings, digging in the sandpile and
pretending a sea-beach, sliding uproariously down their little
wooden toboggan, racing about at tag, gay as butterflies, and ask
them if it pays. Go to the mothers in the shade of the trees of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Workman Place, or culling fresh vegetables and flowers from their
own little gardens, there in the thick of the maelstrom of the
shabbiest part of the city, and ask them. Go to those of the
negro race who have hitherto been forced to live on the Jim Crow
leavings of everything, whether they wanted to be clean and
decent or not, and ask them. But do not ask the landlords who
are losing money because the poor are discovering what it is
reasonable to demand of every landlord. Do not ask a miser
or a skinflint or a misanthrope if it pays.</p>

<p class='c011'>This study has been completely a failure if it has not disclosed
the fact that sense and sentiment are yokefellows to mutual
advantage in this undertaking. There must always be those
for whom philanthropy and business cannot discover a common
denominator. That is why the personal examples of Octavia
Hill and of those who follow in her train are of value, for these
examples prove to a thinking majority that such work as theirs
is not the altruism of dreamy, vague enthusiasts, but that of
persons with “their souls in the work of their hands,” who are
translating into a balance on the right side of the ledger their
aspiration for better things for “the poor and him that hath no
helper.” In twenty-one years this program and its outworking
have been submitted, not once, but again and again, to the
pragmatic test, and have emerged triumphant.</p>

<p class='c011'>The principles on which the enterprise was founded and is
conducted promise its immortality and its expansion indefinite.
It conflicts with no extant organization except the cohesion of
the predatory forces of greed and deception. It does not mean
the duplication of effort or the multiplication of superfluous
offices; it does not economically call for amalgamation with other
societies of parallel function. It meets a need that is real and
constant, and it invokes the support and cooperation of good
citizenship. It must be allowed to help the city more and more,
and in its turn it must always receive the official aid which has
been and is generously accorded.</p>

<p class='c011'>In every large city a problem similar to that which has faced
the Association must be met, if the community does not shirk
the obligation to its own dependent stratum. In every large
city the prestige of the whole community is impaired if dirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>streets, a lack of good water, smoke-clogged air and disreputable
hovels are constituents of the social order. It is a truism that
wherever a large working population congregates these are evils
that call for a vigil unceasing. The fundamental advantages
that make life livable for rich and poor alike are not wafted on
the breath of a pious aspiration. They come by somebody’s
downright work for them. They come by the banded effort of
good citizens. They come by an unremitting holy warfare on
all Apollyon’s brood of evils that are the sequel to the reign of
the spoilsman in politics. If it be a true religion that visits the
fatherless and the widows in their affliction then this is a work
that may well engage the attention of the professors of that
religion, for it keeps a roof over the heads of many who cannot
satisfy a mercenary landlord’s demand. Its appeal is various
and profound; its outreach is beyond any hard-and-fast limitation;
its record is an open book of progress step by step, season
by season toward a goal clearly seen from the start. The Octavia
Hill Association has kept faith with the sainted memory of her
whose name it bears; it has kept faith with the great public of
the city which it is destined to serve more largely as its resources
increase and its assistants multiply; it has kept faith finally,
with its own ideals, which are those of all who believe in that</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
